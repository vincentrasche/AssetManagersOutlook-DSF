Our outlook for the global \neconomy will be shaped by how the support and stimulus enacted to combat the \npandemic are withdrawn. The removal of policy support poses a new challenge for \npolicymakers and a source of risk for financial markets.\n\n ● While the economic recovery is expected to continue through 2022, the easy \n\ngains in growth from rebounding activity are behind us. We expect growth in \nboth the U.S. and the euro area to slow down to 4% in 2022. In China, we expect \ngrowth to fall to about 5%, and in the U.K. we expect growth to be about 5.5%.\n\n ● Inflation has remained high across most economies, driven both by higher demand \nas pandemic restrictions were lifted and by lower supply resulting from global \nlabor and input shortages. Although a return to 1970s-style stagflation is not in \nthe cards, we expect inflation to remain elevated across developed markets as \nthe forces of demand and supply take some time to stabilize.\n\n ● Central banks will have to maintain the delicate balance between keeping \n\ninflation expectations anchored and allowing for a supportive environment for \neconomic growth. As negative supply shocks push inflation higher, they threaten \nto set off a self-fulfilling cycle of ever higher inflation, which could begin to chip \naway at demand. Ultimately, we anticipate that the Federal Reserve will raise \nrates to at least 2.5% by the end of this cycle to keep wage pressures under \ncontrol and to keep inflation expectations stable.\n\n ● As we look toward 2022 and beyond, our long-term outlook for assets is guarded, \nparticularly for equities amid a backdrop of low bond yields, reduced support, \nand stretched valuations. Within fixed income, low interest rates guide our outlook \nfor low returns; however, with rates moving higher since 2020, we see the potential \nfor correspondingly higher returns.\n\nFor professional investors only (as defined under the MiFID II Directive) investing for their own account (including \nmanagement companies (fund of funds) and professional clients investing on behalf of their discretionary clients).

Our view was that economic \ngrowth would prove unusually strong, with the \nprospects for an “inflation scare” as growth \npicked up. As we come to the end of 2021, parts \nof the economy and markets are out of balance. \nLabor demand exceeds supply, financial conditions \nare exceptionally loose even when compared with \nimproved fundamentals, and policy accommodation \nremains extraordinary.\n\nAlthough health outcomes will remain important \nin 2022 given the emergence of the Omicron \nvariant, the outlook for macro economic policy will \nbe more crucial as support and stimulus packages \nenacted to combat the pandemic-driven downturn \nare gradually removed into 2022. The removal of \npolicy support poses a new challenge for policy-\nmakers and a new risk to financial markets.\n\nThe global economic recovery is likely to continue \nin 2022, although we expect the low-hanging  \nfruit of rebounding activity to give way to slower \ngrowth whether supply-chain challenges ease or \nnot. In both the United States and the euro area, \nwe expect growth to slow down to 4%. In the \nU.K., we expect growth of about 5.5%, and in \nChina we expect growth to fall to about 5%. \n\nMore important, labor markets will continue to \ntighten in 2022 given robust labor demand, even \nas growth decelerates. We anticipate that several \nmajor economies, led by the U.S., will quickly \napproach full employment even with a modest \npickup in labor force participation. Wage growth \nshould remain robust, and wage inflation is likely \nto become more influential than headline inflation \nfor the direction of interest rates in 2022.\n\nGlobal inflation: Lower but stickier\n\nInflation has continued to trend higher across \nmost economies, driven by a combination of \nhigher demand as pandemic restrictions were \nlifted and lower supply from global labor and \ninput shortages. While we don’t envision a return \nto 1970s-style inflation, we anticipate that supply/\ndemand frictions will persist well into 2022 and \nkeep inflation elevated across developed and \nemerging markets. That said, it is highly likely \nthat inflation at the end of 2022 will be lower \nthan at the beginning of the year given \nthe unusual run-up in goods prices.\n\nAlthough inflation should cool in 2022, its \ncomposition should be stickier. More persistent \nwage- and shelter-based inflation should remain \nelevated given our employment outlook and will \nbe the critical determinant in central banks’ \nadjustment of policy.\n\nPolicy takes center stage: \nThe risk of a misstep increases\n\nThe global policy response to COVID-19 was \nimpressive and effective. Moving into 2022,  \nhow will policymakers navigate an exit from \nexceptionally accommodative policy? The bounds \nof appropriate policy expanded during the \npandemic, but it’s possible that not all these \npolicies will be unwound as conditions normalize. \nOn the fiscal side, government officials need to \ntrade off between higher spending—due to \npandemic-driven policies—and more balanced \nbudgets to ensure debt sustainability.\n\nOn the monetary side, central bankers will have \nto strike a balance between keeping a lid on \ninflation expectations, given negative supply-side \nshocks, and supporting a return to pre-COVID \nemployment levels. In the United States, that \nbalance should involve the Federal Reserve raising \ninterest rates in the second half of 2022 to ensure \nthat elevated wage inflation does not translate \n\n4\n\n\x0cinto more permanent core inflation. At present, \nwe see the negative risks of too-easy policy \naccommodation outweighing the risks of raising \nshort-term rates. Given conditions in the labor \nand financial markets, the Fed may ultimately \nneed to raise rates to at least 2.5% this cycle, \nhigher than some are expecting.\n\nThe bond market: Rising rates \nwon’t upend markets\n\nDespite modest increases during 2021, govern-\nment bond yields remain below pre-COVID levels. \nThe prospect of rising inflation and policy \nnormalization means that the short-term policy \nrates targeted by the Fed, the European Central \nBank, and other developed-market policymakers \nare likely to rise over the coming year. Credit \nspreads remain generally very tight. Rising rates \nare unlikely to produce negative total returns over \nthe medium and long term, given our inflation \noutlook and given the secular forces that should \nkeep long-term rates low.\n\nGlobal equities: A decade unlike the last\n\nA backdrop of low bond yields, reduced policy \nsupport, and stretched valuations offers a \nchallenging environment despite solid funda-\nmentals. Our Vanguard Capital Markets Model \nfair-value stock projections, which explicitly \n\nincorporate such varied effects, continue to reveal \na global equity market that is drifting close to \novervalued territory, primarily because of U.S. \nstock prices. Our outlook calls not for a lost \ndecade for U.S. stocks, as some fear, but for \na lower-return one.\n\nSpecifically, we are projecting the lowest 10-year \nannualized returns for global equities since the \nearly 2000s. We expect the lowest ones in the \nU.S. (2.3%–4.3% per year), with more attractive \nexpected returns for non-U.S. developed markets \n(5.3%–7.3%) and, to a lesser degree, emerging \nmarkets (4.2%–6.2%). The outlook for the global \nequity risk premium is still positive but lower  \nthan we expected last year, with total returns \nexpected in the range of 2 to 4 percentage points \nover bond returns.\n\nFor U.S. investors, this modest return outlook \nbelies opportunities for those investing broadly \noutside their home market. Recent outperformance \nhas only strengthened our conviction in non-U.S. \nequities, which have more attractive valuations \nthan U.S. equities. Although emerging-market \nequities are above our estimate of fair value, we \nstill expect higher returns than for U.S. equities, \ncombined with diversification benefits for \ninvestors. Within U.S. markets, we think value \nstocks are still more attractive than growth \nstocks, despite value’s outperformance over the \nlast 12 months.\n\n5\n\n\x0cIndexes used in our historical calculations\n\nThe long-term returns for our hypothetical portfolios are based on data for the appropriate \nmarket indexes through September 30, 2021. We chose these benchmarks to provide the best \nhistory possible, and we split the global allocations to align with Vanguard’s guidance in \nconstructing diversified portfolios.\n\nU.S. bonds:  Standard & Poor’s High Grade Corporate Index from 1926 through 1968; Citigroup High \nGrade Index from 1969 through 1972; Lehman Brothers U.S. Long Credit AA Index from 1973 \nthrough 1975; and Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index thereafter.\n\nEx-U.S. bonds:  Citigroup World Government Bond Ex-U.S. Index from 1985 through January 1989 \nand Bloomberg Global Aggregate ex-USD Index thereafter.\n\nGlobal bonds:  Before January 1990, 100% U.S. bonds, as defined above. January 1990 onward, \n70% U.S. bonds and 30% ex-U.S. bonds, rebalanced monthly.\n\nU.S. equities:  S&P 90 Index from January 1926 through March 1957; S&P 500 Index from March \n1957 through 1974; Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 Index from the beginning of 1975 through April 2005; \nand MSCI US Broad Market Index thereafter.\n\nEx-U.S. equities:  MSCI World ex USA Index from January 1970 through 1987 and MSCI All Country \nWorld ex USA Index thereafter.\n\nGlobal equities:  Before January 1970, 100% U.S. equities, as defined above. January 1970 onward, \n60% U.S. equities and 40% ex-U.S. equities, rebalanced monthly.\n\n6\n\n\x0cI. Global economic perspectives \n\nGlobal economic outlook: Striking a \nbetter balance\n\nOur outlook for 2021 focused on the impact of \nhealth outcomes on economic and financial \nmarket conditions (Davis et al., 2020a). Although \nthe evolution of health outcomes will continue to \nplay a significant role in defining our environment, \nour outlook for 2022 and beyond begins to shift \nfocus to macro economic policy or, more specifi-\ncally, the gradual removal of support and stimulus \npackages used to combat the impacts of \nCOVID-19.\n\nInflation has continued to rise across most \neconomies, driven by a combination of higher \ndemand as pandemic restrictions are lifted and \nlower supply due to labor and input shortages \nglobally. Although a return to 1970s-style inflation \nis not in the cards, we expect inflation to peak \nand moderate thereafter over the first half of \n2022 but remain elevated through year-end 2022 \nacross developed and emerging markets. Along \nwith historically high valuations in equity and \nbond markets, these factors are likely to lead to a \nmore volatile and lower-return period for financial \nmarkets in coming years.\n\nIn both the United States and the euro area, we \nexpect growth to slow down to 4%. In the United \nKingdom, we expect growth of about 5.5%, while \nin China we expect growth to fall to about 5%. \nAcross emerging markets, growth could prove \nuneven, aggregating to 5.5%.\n\nOur outlook presents the case for such an \nenvironment in the near to medium term by \noutlining the array of historically large and diverse \npolicies enacted, estimating their impact, and \nanalyzing how the expected unwinding of these \npolicies will affect the economy and markets.\n\n7\n\n\x0cPolicy matters: It was different this time\nIn the years surrounding the global financial  \ncrisis (GFC), macroeconomic policy drew a level  \nof attention not seen since the so-called Great \nModeration began in the mid-1980s. Before the \nfinancial crisis, it was believed that the business \ncycle had been tamed, with less need for \nsignificant policy support, either monetary  \nor fiscal.\n\nWith the onset of the GFC, debates about the \nmagnitude, duration, and structure of policy \nsupport needed to steer economies through the \ntumult were heated, with both sides presenting \ntheoretical and mathematical support for their \nviews. Although the degree of monetary and fiscal \nsupport during the GFC was unprecedented, the \n\nscale, breadth, and duration of monetary support \nsurpassed that of fiscal support as concerns over \nfiscal policy’s adverse effects (inflation and debt \nloads, for example) led to more austere conditions \nsooner than some thought warranted, particularly \nin the euro zone.\n\nSuch considerations were put aside when the \nneed to address the COVID-19 pandemic’s health \nand economic fallout became apparent. This \nperhaps was not surprising given the scale of  \nthe shock to the global economy, but it was \nnoteworthy nonetheless. Figure I-1 shows that \nmonetary support was implemented in markets \nto magni tudes unthinkable before the pandemic. \nFiscal support, too, was historic in its magnitude, \nand duration.\n\nFIGURE I-1\nA macroeconomic policy experiment in real time\n\n60%\n\nFiscal stimulus\n\nEquity, loans, guarantees\n\n49.8%\n\nOther stimulus\n\nWorker support\n\n36.0%\n\nMonetary stimulus\n\nReserve lending \n\nAsset purchases\n\n35.3%\n\n23.5%\n\n21.2%\n\n19.9%\n\n \n\n \n\nP\nD\nG\n9\n1\n0\n2\nf\no\ne\ng\na\nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\nP\n\n \n\n \n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n5.0%\n\nU.S.\n\nU.K.\n\nEuro area\n\nChina\n\nU.S. Federal \nReserve\n\nBank of\nEngland\n\nEuropean \nCentral Bank\n\nNotes: All stimulus percentages are based on 2019 Nominal GDP. Fiscal stimulus: For worker support for the euro area, an average of spending for Germany, Italy, and Spain is \nused to estimate aggregate European Union support. For equity, loans, and guarantees,  an average across Germany, Italy, Spain, and France is used for an EU aggregate estimate. \nFor the U.K., total spending on unemployment benefits and furlough (for both employed and self-employed individuals) is used. For the U.S., we obtained the data from the \nCommittee for a Responsible Federal Budget. For China, we obtained the data from the Ministry of Finance and State Taxation Administration. Across all regions, worker support \nincludes income support and direct payments. Other stimulus includes tax policy, state and local funding, health care spending, and other spending. Equity, loans, and guarantees \ninclude the loans and grant spending. Monetary stimulus: For the euro area, asset purchases during the pandemic were conducted under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase \nProgramme (PEPP) and the pre-pandemic Asset Purchase Programme (APP). Reserves were made available through targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs).  \nFor the U.K., assets were purchased by the Asset Purchase Facility and reserves made available through the Term Funding Scheme with extra incentives. For the U.S., we include \nasset purchases under quantitative easing and the peak amount disbursed under various emergency lending facilities. \nSources: Bloomberg, dw.com, Office for National Statistics, International Monetary Fund, and Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (see covidmoneytracker.org/explore-\ndata/interactive-table) and Clarida, Burcu, and Scotti, 2021). \n\n8\n\n\x0cMonetary policy: Change amid uncertainty\nAlthough much work remains to be done to \ncombat COVID-19, particularly in emerging \nmarkets, most developed-market central  \nbanks (as of this writing) have announced plans \nto start gradually removing monetary stimulus \n(Figure I-2).1 As that accommodation is removed, \nmonetary conditions in the world will remain \nhighly accom modative but become less so  \nover time.\n\nInflationary pressures have sharpened the  \nfocus on monetary policymakers and may drive \nchanges in policy actions and how they are \ncommunicated. However, as long as evidence \npoints to these pressures being transient, central \nbanks will not overreact, and will remain vigilant \n\nto the risk of higher expectations of inflation \nfeeding through into more persistent shifts in \nwage and price increases.2\n\nAmid the pandemic uncertainty, some developed-\nmarket central banks shifted their approach to \npolicymaking to try to more consistently achieve \ntheir inflation targets. Rather than aim for an \nexplicit target of 2% or close to it, the U.S. Federal \nReserve would now seek to achieve average \ninflation of 2% over time or more explicitly allow \nfor above-target inflation after periods of weaker \nprice growth. The European Central Bank \nannounced a shift to a symmetric 2% target. \nThese shifts, in general, signal a desire by \npolicymakers to tolerate inflation that runs  \nabove their pre-pandemic target range.\n\nFIGURE I-2\nThe long and winding road to normalcy\n\nThe removal of monetary accommodation will be gradual\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\n2025\n\nQ1\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ1\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ1\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ1\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ1\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nPandemic Emergency Purchase \nProgramme (PEPP) expected to end\n\nOverall quantitative easing (QE) \nexpected to end\n\n“Fighting retreat” data-dependent policy\n\nTighten\ncredit\ngrowth\n\nMacro\npolicy\nloosens\n\nReduce pace\nof asset\npurchases\n\nBalance\nsheet stops\ngrowing\n\nShrink\nbalance\nsheet\n\nLift\nrates\n\nNotes: Vanguard assessments are as of November 1, 2021, and are of actions taken or likely to be taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the European Central \nBank, and the People’s Bank of China. Under a “fighting retreat” mode, China’s government would accept that growth will need to slow down, but at a gradual pace. If the \ndeceleration is gradual, the government will not intervene and instead will focus on reforms and financial stability. But if the pace is rapid and creates market panic, the government \nwill fight against the trend to stabilize the growth. This will allow the government to engineer a smooth deleveraging process and soft landing.\nSource: Vanguard, as of November 1, 2021.\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve\n\nEuropean Central Bank\n\nBank of England\n\nPeople’s Bank of China\n\n1  Emerging-market and some developed-market central banks have already either started removing accommodation (for example, by tapering or ceasing asset purchases) or \nare expected to start raising rates earlier than previously anticipated, primarily as a result of higher-than-expected spot inflation and the resulting rise in medium- to long-\nterm inflation expectations.\n\n2  Overall, the main factors pushing up inflation in 2021 are (1) higher demand as economies reopen, (2) labor and materials shortages, (3) higher energy prices, especially in \n\nEurope, (4) expansionary fiscal and monetary policies through the pandemic, and (5) other factors related to pandemic-induced distortions. These pressures are expected to \nease over 2022. A major risk to this view is if these pressures more permanently affect wage negotiations, which could fuel more persistent price increases.\n\n9\n\n\x0cFuture policy decisions must also consider the \ndrop in developed-market neutral rates.3 Since \nwell before even the GFC, global neutral rates \nhave been falling (Figure I-3a). This presents \nchallenges for policymakers, as the monetary \npolicy stance is calibrated in tandem with the \nestimate of neutral rates. If neutral rates are low, \nthey act as an anchor for policy rates, which in \n\nturn would remain closer to the theoretical floor of \nthe zero lower bound.4 The factors that drove the \ndrop in neutral rates (Figure I-3b) are unlikely to \nabate materially over the coming years. However, \nwe can see some of these trends reversing, thereby \npushing up neutral rates moderately in the future \n(Figure I-3b).\n\nFIGURE I-3\nA secular decline in neutral rates\n\na.

We work with data from 1982 to 2021. We estimate \nthe long-run cointegrating relationship via fully modified OLS (ordinary least squares) of the real short-term interest rates as well as six factors that we believe have driven the \nneutral rate: productivity (as measured by total factor productivity, or TFP, growth); demographics (as measured by the share of the working-age population aged 15 to 24);  \nrisk aversion (as measured by the spread in 10-year yields for BAA-rated bonds and Treasuries); income inequality (as measured by top 10% to bottom 50%); the relative price of \ncapital (as measured by the price of equipment and machinery to consumption); and the savings glut (as measured by the current account percentage GDP in China). The long-run \ncointegrating relationship is the source of our neutral rate estimate for each country. \nSource: Vanguard, as of November 1, 2021.\n\n3  The neutral (or natural) rate of interest is the real interest rate that would prevail when the economy is at full employment and stable inflation; it is the rate at which \n\n4  As short-term interest rates reach the zero lower bound, further monetary easing becomes difficult, leading to the need for unconventional monetary policy, such as large-\n\nmonetary policy is neither expansionary nor contractionary.\n\nscale asset purchases (quantitative easing).\n\n10\n\n\x0cAlthough low neutral rates may mean that bond \ninvestors need not fear interest rates, it may also \nmean that addressing the next downturn could \npresent additional challenges to monetary \npolicymakers. Another issue central bankers \nwould need to grapple with is the increasing \ndeficit spending implemented to counter the \npandemic’s impact on household and business \n\nbalance sheets. As shown in Figure I-4, sustained \nfiscal spending could push inflation higher, adding \nto the concerns of central bank policymakers.  \nThe upside is that central banks appeared willing \nto deploy creative solutions to a litany of issues \nduring the most recent downturn and would likely \nstand readyto do so again.\n\nFIGURE I-4\nDeficit spending over an extended period puts additional pressure on policymakers\n\ne\ng\nn\na\nh\nc\n \nr\na\ne\ny\n-\nn\no\n-\nr\na\ne\ny\n \n,\n\n \n\nE\nC\nP\ne\nr\no\nC\n\n \n)\ny\nc\nn\ne\nu\nq\ne\nr\nf\ny\n\n \n\nl\nr\ne\nt\nr\na\nu\nq\n(\n\n4.5%\n\n4.0\n\n3.5\n\n3.0\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\nVanguard \nforecast\n\nCore PCE actual\n\nSustained\n5% deﬁcit\n\nFed model\nbaseline\n(FRB/US)\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\n2025\n\n2026\n\n2027\n\n2028\n\n2029\n\n2030\n\nNotes: The figure uses U.S. core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), which exclude volatile food and energy costs.

If industries \nwere shuttered and workers told to stay home,  \nas they were during the pandemic, the response \nneeded to be—and was—much different.\n\nOne of the most notable changes came in Europe \nwhen, after years of discussion and debate, \nEuropean Union officials issued supranational \ndebt aimed at supporting specific needs of \nindividual countries while being backed by the \ncollective group. As with monetary policy, there \nare likely to be legacy effects of fiscal policy \n\nmeasures enacted during the pandemic. More \nbroadly, the most lasting impact of the pandemic-\ndriven fiscal packages will be higher levels of debt \nto gross domestic product (GDP) ratios.\n\nHigh debt levels, particularly for countries  \nthat issue it in their own currencies, are not in \nthemselves an issue. Indeed, government debt \ncan represent an efficient mechanism for \nfinancing capital expenditure that delivers \neconomic and social benefits over an extended \nperiod. But high debt caused by excessive current \nspending represents an inappropriate build-up of \nmacroeconomic and financial burdens on future \ngenerations. So it is clear that governments \ncannot continue to borrow and spend in perpetuity \nand debt levels can become excessive. In that \ncontext, there is no specific debt level at which \ngrowth or other macroeconomic fundamentals \nare suddenly impaired. The discussion should \nfocus on debt sustainability, which differs by \ncountry based on several factors, some of which \nare outlined in Figure I-5.\n\nFIGURE I-5\nBroadening the debt discussion: Debt sustainability metrics in advanced economies\n\nNet debt to GDP ratio \n\nInterest payments as a  \npercentage of GDP \n\nU.S.\n\nU.K.\n\nFrance\n\nJapan\n\nItaly\n\nCanada Germany\n\n109.0\n\n97.2\n\n106.1\n\n172.3\n\n144.2\n\n37.0\n\n52.5\n\n \n\n1.6\n\n1.1\n\n0.8\n\n0.3\n\n2.7\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\nInterest rate growth differential \n\n–2.3\n\n–2.8\n\n–2.3\n\n–1.0\n\n–0.5\n\n–3.6\n\n–2.8\n\nProjected primary surplus/deficit\n\n–3.1\n\n–2.4\n\n–2.8\n\n–2.0\n\n0.3\n\n–0.1\n\n0.8\n\nTax to GDP ratio\n\n30.0\n\n35.7\n\n52.5\n\n33.6\n\n47.9\n\n40.1\n\n46.1\n\nInterest payment as a share  \nof tax revenue\n\n5.8\n\n3.5\n\n2.2\n\n0.9\n\n4.8\n\n5.3\n\n1.8\n\nUnsustainable debt \n\n Sustainable debt\n\nNotes: For calculations, Net debt to GDP ratio = Debt/GDP; interest payments as a percentage of GDP = i/GDP; interest rate growth differential = i-g (both are in real terms);  \ntax to GDP ratio = Tax/GDP; interest payment as a share of tax revenue = i/tax.

That is where the concept of fiscal \nspace comes in (Ostry et al., 2010, and Zandi, \nCheng, and Packard, 2011).\n\nFiscal space is a concept that estimates how \nmuch more debt a country can issue before \nreaching a tipping point. Absent unprecedented \nchanges in fiscal policy, it is estimated that \ncrossing that level would trigger a debt crisis. \nRather than identifying one absolute level of \ndebt, this measure accounts for factors such  \nas interest rates, reserve currency status, and a \ncountry’s history of tax and spending policies in \nidentifying a level of unsustainable debt/GDP. \nBeyond these maximum debt levels, faith in that \ncountry’s willingness and ability to service its \ndebt burden erodes, with detrimental implications \nfor economic fundamentals and financial markets.\n\nAs Figure I-6 shows, debt limits differ for each \ncountry. Countries should not seek to approach \nthese limits, as they mark a level at which default \nbecomes highly likely—such that even before the \nlimit is reached, one would expect financial and \neconomic unease. This could extend into social \nunrest if implemented austerity measures are \nsufficiently harsh, as happened in Greece during \nthe European debt crisis (Ponticelli and Voth, 2020).\n\nFIGURE I-6\nPushing the limit(s): Stylized debt limits \nunder alternative assumptions\n\nIncreasing interest burden\nInterest rate growth \n(r–g) differential\n\nCurrent \ndebt/GDP\n\n1.0%\n\n1.5% 2.0%\n\n2.5%\n\nU.S.\n\nU.K.\n\nAustralia\n\nGermany\n\nJapan\n\n103% 508% 338%\n\nx\n\nx\n\n104\n\n62\n\n69\n\n256\n\n831\n\n693\n\n1,080\n\nx\n\n554\n\n462\n\n720\n\nx\n\n415% 332%\n\n346\n\n540\n\nx\n\n  \n\n272\n\n432\n\nx\n\nUnsustainable debt \n\n Sustainable debt\n\nNotes: The results are obtained from a stylized Primary Balance Reaction Function \nfor the U.S., U.K., Australia, Germany, and Japan, specified using a logistic form \nand altered according to the maximum attainable primary surplus, combined with \ndiffering values for r-g. The red X’s indicate debt that is on an unsustainable path at \nthe given r-g level. This applies particularly for Japan (which has a very high debt/GDP \nratio). For r-g even as low as 1%, the debt/GDP ratio must be lower than current levels \nfor debt to be sustainable. As interest rate burdens increase from left to right, the level \nof sustainable debt/GDP ratio for various regions is estimated to decline. \nSources: International Monetary Fund and Vanguard, as of September 21, 2021.\n\n5 \n\nIn 2011, a deepening sovereign debt crisis prompted the deployment of bailouts with stringent fiscal conditions and made European policymakers wary of enacting  \nausterity measures.\n\n13\n\n\x0cAddressing high debt levels is possible without \ninducing social unrest. Such policies would typically \ninvolve a combination of factors, including \nmacroeconomic policy to affect inflation and \ngrowth as well as changes to tax and spending \npolicies (Boz and Tesar, 2021). Policymakers have \nthe most control over this latter set of changes, \nwhich determine a country’s primary fiscal \nbalance. Figure I-7 shows that such changes, \nprovided they are enacted in a timely manner, \ncould help achieve sustainability. The shaded \ncircles in the figure show the current projected \nprimary balance for a selection of developed-\nmarket economies, and the empty circles show \nthe estimated primary balance, based on the \nfiscal space framework, that a country will need \nto achieve sustainability. \n\nSome countries already enjoy a primary balance \nthat would allow their debt to remain sustainable \nunder current assumptions. A modest reduction \nshould be sufficient for now, for those that must \nmake policy changes, including the U.S. But as \ntime goes on and interest rates rise and deficits \npersist, the need for change becomes more \npertinent and difficult. As the pandemic fades, \ncountries should begin addressing these \ndislocations or they will face greater pain in  \nthe future, and their ability to address crises  \nor recessions with fiscal policy will continue  \nto deteriorate. \n \n\nFIGURE I-7\nLow rates provide some breathing space, but debt sustainability is a looming concern\n\nReduction or increase in deficit consistent with stable debt\n\nReduction in deﬁcit\nconsistent with stable debt \n\nIncrease in deﬁcit\nconsistent with stable debt \n\nPercentage\nof GDP\n\n2026\nprojected\ndeﬁcit \n\nTightening \nrequired \n\n2026\nstable\ndebt\ndeﬁcit \n\n–3.0\n\n–0.51\n\n–2.4\n\n–2.7\n\n–0.38\n\n–2.3\n\n–2.0\n\n–0.16\n\n–1.8\n\nBalanced budget\n\n–2.6\n\n0.50\n\n–2.1\n\n–2.9\n\n3.24\n\n0.4\n\n–1.5\n\n2.47\n\n0.9\n\n–0.6\n\n1.24\n\n0.7\n\nPrimary\ndeﬁcit\n\nPrimary\nsurplus\n\nU.S.\n\nFrance\n\nJapan\n\nU.K.\n\nCanada\n\nItaly\n\nGermany\n\nNotes: Units are presented as a percentage of GDP. A negative interest rate growth differential (r-g) allows some countries, such as the U.S., France, and Japan, to run a deficit \nwhile sustainably servicing interest burdens. Countries with a positive interest rate growth differential must maintain a debt surplus in order to maintain stable debt dynamics. \nStable debt refers to debt levels (surplus or deficit) that keep debt on a controlled path.\nSources: International Monetary Fund and Vanguard, as of September 21, 2021.\n\n14\n\n\x0cCounterfactuals: What could have been?\nWe’ve outlined some of the extraordinary \nmeasures that monetary and fiscal policymakers \nhave taken to try to offset the impact of the \npandemic-driven economic shutdown. Some of \nthese measures will be rolled back and, hopefully, \nwill not be necessary again. But their effects, \nsuch as higher debt levels, will persist, at least  \nin the medium term. Others, such as average \ninflation targeting, are likely to remain as policy \nfeatures going forward. But what if these policies \nhad not been enacted?\n\nDuring a typical downturn, incomes fall because \nof job losses, resulting in a drop in demand, which \nthen leads to overcapacity and then to supply cuts, \nresulting in more job losses and so on until some \nform of monetary or fiscal intervention interrupts \nthe cycle. This time, the downturn was far from \ntypical, with large enforced falls in productive \npotential as sectors of the economy were shut \n\ndown, as well as associated falls in demand as \nconsumer confidence fell. As a result, it was clear \nthat output and labor markets would feel severe \nadverse effects from interventions to stop the \nspread of COVID-19, governments intervened \nswiftly and forcefully with untested policies.  \nThe ensuing months revealed the benefits and \ncosts of such measures.\n\nIn the U.S., for instance, fiscal policymakers \nagreed to combat the possible deterioration  \nof household balance sheets as a result of job \nlosses with levels of support previously unheard \nof, including stimulus checks and additional \nunemployment insurance payments. Figure I-8 \nshows that, counterintuitively, certain measures \nof income in the U.S., instead of falling, rose \nduring the downturn—a pattern similar, though \nnot in terms of magnitude, to that following the \nfinancial crisis.\n\nFIGURE I-8\nIncomes rose substantially in the U.S. during the downturn\n\na.

Critically, supply-and-demand imbalances \nhave become more pronounced of late and \nthreaten to weigh on output and exacerbate \ninflation pressures in 2022, increasing the risk \nthat policymakers are late in withdrawing \naccommodation.\n\nShortages of labor and materials combined with \nlogistical bottlenecks resulting in elevated prices \nhave emerged as key risks, and how and when \n\nthese will normalize remains highly uncertain. \nFigure I-13 shows the current severity of those \nconstraints, well beyond the drag imposed during \na typical late-cycle economy, bringing focus to the \ncircumstances needed for them to improve.\n\nJob growth has accelerated to finish 2021, but  \nas we progress into 2022, we expect the pace to \nmoderate as the supply of unemployed people \nseeking work is depleted and competition among \nbusinesses intensifies to attract talent from \nother firms. \n\nFIGURE I-13\nLabor shortages are acute at this point in the business cycle\n\nMarch\n2012\n\nMarch\n2013\n\nMarch\n2014\n\nMarch\n2015\n\nMarch\n2016\n\nMarch\n2017\n\nMarch\n2018\n\nMarch\n2019\n\nMarch\n2020\n\nMarch\n2021\n\n0\n\n–0.5\n\n–1.0\n\n–1.5\n\n–2.0\n\n–2.5\n\n–3.0\n\n–3.5%\n\nQuarterly GDP lost from labor \nand supply constraints\n\nLabor\n\nSupply\n\nNotes: Output lost is measured as the percentage of quarterly gross domestic product that is forgone because of labor and supply constraints.

Retirements have contributed \nmost to the decline in labor force participation \nsince the pandemic started, with net retirements \nand unanticipated retirements totaling about  \n2 million as of June 2021 (Figure I-14). Although \nsome of these retirements were planned even \n\nbefore the pandemic, more than half were \nunanticipated.8 The unanticipated retirements \nhave generally been those of older and wealthier \nworkers previously employed in higher-wage \nindustries and workers who originally expected to \nretire in coming years. Thus, we expect that only a \nfraction of these unanticipated retirees will return \nto the labor force.\n\nFIGURE I-14\nThe labor force is unlikely to recover to pre-COVID levels\n\nA very tight labor market \nshould entice the majority of \nthese workers back into the \nlabor force by mid-2022\n\nWe expect that 75% of these \nunanticipated retirees will still \nbe out of the labor force at \nyear-end 2023\n\nReasons for leaving\nthe labor force\nsince 2019\n\n20%\n\nNet retirements (652,000)\n\n45%\n\nUnanticipated retirements (1.5M)\n\n5%\n\nFamily responsibilities (163,000)\n\n25%\n\nNot in labor force but want a job (815,000)\n\n5%\n\nOther (163,000)\n\nNotes: Percentages represent the contribution to the overall decline in labor force participation. Net retirements refers to expected retirements minus new labor market entrants. \nThis is a normal labor market rotation that occurs as older workers retire and younger workers enter the labor force. This rotation will have a net negative effect on the labor force \nfrom 2020 to 2025 because retirements will exceed new labor market entrants. Unanticipated retirements are retirements in excess of what our demographic models predicted—\nworkers who likely retired as a result of pandemic implications. Family responsibilities refers to those who are not working because they are caring for family. Other includes those \nwho have left the labor force to continue their education or because of a disability. All figures represent the change from the fourth quarter of 2019 through the second quarter  \nof 2021.\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, as of June 30, 2021.\n\n8  The unanticipated decline in retirements is calculated by comparing the current data with our estimates from the proprietary labor force participation model described in \n\nPatterson et al. (2019).\n\n21\n\n\x0cThis paradox of elevated labor demand and weak \nlabor force growth suggests that the official \nunemployment rate will reach the pre-pandemic \nlow of 3.5% in mid-2022 but that the labor force \nparticipation rate may peak nearly a percentage \npoint lower than its 63.3% level of February 2020. \nSuch a scenario as shown in Figure I-15, in which \nthe labor market proves tighter than previously \nanticipated, would present significant challenges \nfor the Fed in assessing the appropriate time to \nbegin raising its policy rate, further exacerbated \nby still-elevated inflation. These conditions form \nthe core of the 2022 risks we outlined earlier.\n\nRecently, elevated inflation has raised questions \nabout its persistence, which could dampen the \nrecovery and risk Fed action earlier than expected. \nWe estimate that the effects from supply \nconstraints will persist well into early 2022 before \nwe see inflation normalizing gradually toward the \npre-pandemic trend. These factors contribute to \nour expectations that inflation will stay elevated \nfor some time before slowing in the second  \nhalf of next year, bringing the Core Personal \nConsumption Expenditures Price Index for  \nyear-end 2022 in the range of 2.3%–2.6% year \nover year.\n\nFIGURE I-15\nU.S. to reach full-employment range \nby mid-2022\n\nPeriod of\naccelerated\njob growth\n\nFull-employment\nrange\n\n6%\n\ne\nt\na\nr\n \nt\nn\ne\nm\ny\no\n\nl\n\np\nm\ne\nn\nU\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\nJune\n2021\n\nJan.\n2022\n\nJune\n2022\n\nJan.\n2023\n\nNote: The dotted line depicts the Vanguard headline (U-3) unemployment  \nrate forecast.\nSources: Vanguard forecast and calculations, based on Refinitiv data, as of \nSeptember 30, 2021.\n\nBased on our understanding of the Fed’s liftoff \ncriteria, we expect them to focus on two key \naspects of the economy: (1) labor market \nconditions improving to the point of full employ-\nment and (2) inflation to be sustainably at or \nmoderately above 2%.9 Given our labor market \nestimates, we expect to be within range of full \nemployment by the second half of 2022; at that \npoint, it will be difficult for the Fed to justify \nholding off on rate hikes through the end of the \nyear.

Strict lockdowns \nacross the region constrained supply, and \nconsumer demand remained weak. In addition, \ninitial vaccine production and distribution \ndisruptions as well as relatively high vaccine \nhesitancy delayed the start of the vaccination \nrollout compared with other developed markets.\n\nThe vaccination pace accelerated substantially  \nin the second quarter, leading to a broad-based \neasing of restrictions and supporting a strong \nbounce-back in activity over subsequent months. \nIn the third quarter, output was only about  \n0.5% below the level attained at the end of 2019 \n(Figure I-16). Economic momentum, however, has \nsince slowed as the reopening boost continues to \nmoderate, amplified by slowing global growth, \nintensifying supply-chain disruptions, and more \nrecently a tightening of restrictions due to the \nemergence of the Omicron variant. Overall, the \neuro-area economy is anticipated to have grown \nby 5% in 2021, in line with our prediction in our \n2021 outlook.\n\nLooking ahead to 2022, we expect infection- and \nvaccine-acquired immunity to remain relatively \nsuccessful in mitigating the pressure on hospital \nsystems,10 which will allow for a continued \neconomic recovery. In our central scenario, we \nexpect that the euro-area economy will grow  \nby 4% in 2022, and that by the end of 2022, GDP \nwill be only about 0.5% below the trajectory we \nexpected pre-COVID.\n\nFIGURE I-16\nEuro-area growth set to limit long-run scarring\n\nUpside\n\nDownside\n\n10%\n\n \n\ne\ng\nn\na\nh\nc\ne\ng\na\nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\np\ne\nv\n\n \n\ni\nt\na\n\nl\n\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\n9\n1\n0\n2\n \nr\ne\nb\nm\ne\nc\ne\nD\nm\no\nr\nf\ns\nl\n\n \n\n \n\ne\nv\ne\n\nl\n \n\nP\nD\nG\nn\n\n \n\ni\n\n5\n\n0\n\n–5\n\n–10\n\n–15\n\n–20\n\nPre-COVID-19 trend\n\nBaseline\n\nDec.\n2019\n\nDec.\n2020\n\nDec.\n2021\n\nDec.\n2022\n\nDec.\n2023\n\nNotes: The y-axis represents the level impact from the baseline, which is  \nDecember 2019.

In recent \nmonths, a surge in energy prices due to natural \ngas shortages put substantial upward pressure \non inflation. As has been the case across most \ndeveloped economies, inflation pressure has been \nconcentrated in the goods sector, while services \ninflation has remained subdued. Importantly, we \nsee the factors driving up inflation as largely \ntransitory. We anticipate that inflation will fall \nbelow its current level by mid-2022, while staying \nslightly elevated above its 2014–2019 average \n(Figure I-17). A major risk to this view is if price \npressures feed into expectations and wage \nnegotiations, which could fuel a more persistent \nincrease in inflation and put pressure on central \nbank policy.\n\nThe ECB in 2021 concluded its strategy review, \nthe first in almost two decades. Key changes \nincluded a shift to a symmetric 2% target—\ncompared with the previous “below but close  \nto 2%” wording (for more details, see the  \nearlier section “Monetary policy: Change amid \nuncertainty”)—and an ambitious climate- \nrelated action plan.\n\nElectricity and fuel\n\nOperation of vehicles\n\nVehicles\n\nHeadline inﬂation\n\nHousehold maintenance\n\nHousehold equipment \n\nOther\n\nCommunications\n\nWater and sewage\n\nClothing\n\nRestaurants\n\nEducation\n\nRent\n\nFood\n\nAlcohol\n\nHealth\n\nAccommodation\n\nTransport services\n\nRecreational and culture\n\nCurrent\n\nMid-2022 projection\n\nNotes: The figure shows the three-month average of the year-over-year rate of \ninflation for various sectors as of September 2021 in terms of its deviation from the \n2014–2019 average.

Asset purchases will \nnonetheless continue far beyond that. Similarly, \nwe don’t currently expect rate hikes over at least \nthe next 24 months—a timeline that differs \nmarkedly from current market pricing. This highly \naccommodative monetary policy stance is \n\njustified by the ECB’s relatively sanguine medium-\nterm inflation outlook, but higher-than-anticipated \ninflation mixed with supply constraints may \npressure policymakers. Despite recent shocks, \ninflation is expected to fall below the ECB’s newly \nexplicit 2% target by the end of its forecasting \nhorizon.

Budget deficits remained high in \n2021; they ranged from 8.6% to 10.2% in France, \nItaly, and Spain and were about 7% in Germany.12\n\nOne benefit of the pandemic has been approval \nof the NextGenerationEU package. Its centerpiece \nis a 750-billion-euro recovery fund, designed to \nhelp repair the pandemic-driven immediate \ndamage and to invest in a greener and more \ndigital Europe.13 The European Commission will \nfinance it, borrowing on the markets at more \nfavorable rates than many member states. The \nfunds will be distributed over the coming years \nand are expected to moderately boost GDP by \nabout 20 to 40 basis points a year, with a larger \neffect in Southern European economies  \n(Figure I-19).

It is calculated as the difference in the fiscal impulse with and without the \nrecovery fund. The fiscal impulse is defined as the fiscal stance (the change in the \nstructural budget deficit) multiplied by a fiscal multiplier, which is assumed to be 0.7.\nSources: Vanguard, the International Monetary Fund Fiscal Monitor, and Bloomberg, \nas of November 2, 2021.\n\n12  Deficit figures reflect the General Government Overall Balance, according to the International Monetary Fund’s Fiscal Monitor, October 2021.\n\n13  This amount is commonly expressed in 2018 prices (and is about 800 billion euros in current prices, as of the third quarter of 2021).\n\n26\n\n\x0cUnited Kingdom: Bank is committed to \nfirm but cautious tightening path\n\nIn similar fashion to the euro area, the U.K. \neconomy experienced another downturn in \neconomic activity in early 2021 as the govern-\nment enacted a new lockdown to limit the spread \nof COVID-19. Activity contracted sharply in the \nfirst quarter, driven by a 4.4% drop in household \nconsumption from the previous quarter.\n\nHowever, amid a successful vaccination rollout \nand significant easing of restrictions, the U.K. \neconomy recovered strongly during mid-2021. \nConsumer confidence returned, households drove \ndown part of their excess savings built up during \nthe pandemic, and many businesses reopened. In \nthe latter part of the year, momentum slowed as \nthe impulse from reopening faded and activity \nbecame increasingly restrained by labor, material, \nand energy shortages both in the U.K. and globally. \nDespite this slowdown, we still expect annual \ngrowth of about 7% in 2021, broadly in line with \nour forecast in our 2021 outlook.\n\nAs we look ahead to 2022, the U.K. economy  \nwill see growth challenges that will lower real \ndisposable incomes. These include the end of  \nthe government-subsidized furlough program; \nreduced unemployment benefits; and higher \ntaxes on income, consumption, and corporate \nprofits, as well as higher energy prices. However, \nthese drags on consumption will be at least \nsomewhat counteracted by robust wage growth \nand households’ large stock of excess savings.  \nWe therefore expect economic growth of 5.5%  \nin 2022. This would leave GDP about 2% below  \nits pre-pandemic trend (Figure I-20)—a greater \nshortfall than that projected for the euro area, \nmainly because the U.K. faces additional Brexit-\nrelated headwinds.\n\nFIGURE I-20\nRecovery to decelerate but remain firm \nthroughout 2022\n\nPre-COVID-19\ntrend\n\nUpside\n\nDownside\n\nBaseline\n\n10%\n\n \n\ne\ng\nn\na\nh\nc\ne\ng\na\nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\np\ne\nv\n\n \n\ni\nt\na\n\nl\n\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\n9\n1\n0\n2\n \nr\ne\nb\nm\ne\nc\ne\nD\nm\no\nr\nf\ns\nl\n\n \n\n \n\ne\nv\ne\n\nl\n \n\nP\nD\nG\nn\n\n \n\ni\n\n5\n\n0\n\n–5\n\n–10\n\n–15\n\n–20\n\n–25\n\nDec.\n2019\n\nDec.\n2020\n\nDec.\n2021\n\nDec.\n2022\n\nDec.\n2023\n\nNotes: The y-axis represents the level impact from the baseline, which is  \nDecember 2019.

This was driven by \nincreased demand as the economy reopened  \nand by a sharp rise in energy prices, among other \nfactors. As we enter 2022, inflation is set to rise \nfurther amid higher food and gas prices, rising \npressures from non-energy industrial sectors such \nas steel and chemicals, a quicker pass-through \nfrom higher food prices, and a large April increase \nin the energy price cap.14 We expect headline CPI \nto peak between 4.5% and 5% in the first half of \n2022 and approach 2.5% year over year by the \nend of 2022.\n\n14  The cap sets the maximum price an energy supplier can charge for electricity and gas.\n\n27\n\n\x0cThe larger and more persistent inflation shock \nhas raised concern among Monetary Policy \nCommittee (MPC) members at the Bank of \nEngland, some of whom worry that without  \nany central bank action, these dynamics will \nmeaningfully spill over into medium-term  \ninflation expectations. Policymakers, though, \nmust balance the risk of inflation expectations \nde-anchoring with a potential labor market \nsoftening as the furlough program unwinds.  \nIn our base case, as Figure I-21 illustrates, we \nexpect only a modest rise in unemployment to \nabout 4.5% as most of the 1.3 million furloughed \nworkers are absorbed by the labor market by  \nthe end of 2021. The employment outlook is \nexpected to remain strong, particularly as labor \ndemand appears ample, as evidenced by record \njob vacancies.\n\nWe expect the MPC to begin raising interest \nrates in December 2021, provided that October \nlabor market data are in line with our expectations. \nThis will serve to signal to investors that the  \nMPC is serious about fighting inflation and to \nmaintain credibility. If progress in the labor \nmarket disappoints materially, or if there are \nsigns of a considerable slowdown in economic \nactivity because of the Omicron variant, then  \nwe expect the first rate hike to be delayed till \nFebruary 2022. It will likely be followed by another \n25-basis-point rate hike at the committee’s \n\nsubsequent meeting. This would take the Bank \nRate to 0.5%, allowing the central bank to \ncommence balance-sheet runoff starting in the \nsecond quarter of 2022. The quantitative easing \nprogram will end in December 2021, as the bank \nhas communicated (see the earlier section \n“Monetary policy: Change amid uncertainty”).\n\nFIGURE I-21\nLabor market to remain strong despite \nfurlough’s end\n\nActual\n\n6%\n\ne\nt\na\nr\n \nt\nn\ne\nm\ny\no\n\nl\n\np\nm\ne\nn\nU\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nDownside\n\nBase case\n\nUpside\n\nNov.\n2019\n\nJun.\n2020\n\nJan.\n2021\n\nAug.\n2021\n\nMar.\n2022\n\nOct.\n2022\n\nMay\n2023\n\nDec.\n2023\n\nNotes: The upside labor market scenario assumes that only 10% of currently \nfurloughed workers lose their jobs once the scheme ends and only 30% of these newly \nunemployed workers stay in the labor force.

With the government likely to set  \nthe growth target around 5%–6%, compared \nwith above 6% in 2021, this suggests that \npolicymakers will likely either tolerate a more \ntepid recovery or unveil further stimulus \nmeasures to support the economy. \n\n15  The objective of this strategy is to keep transmission of the virus as close to zero as possible and, ultimately, to eliminate it entirely through strict lockdowns.\n\n29\n\n\x0cUnlike most developed economies, which have \ngradually eased lockdowns as vaccination rates \nincrease, China has maintained a strict zero-\nCOVID lockdown strategy even though over  \n70% of its population has been fully vaccinated, \nmaking the economic reopening unsustainable \nand stifling the consumption and services sector. \nAs a case in point, household consumption has \nremained significantly below its trend, dropping \nfrom –3.0% to –5.4% in the third quarter of  \n2021, in contrast with the U.S., which was 5% \nabove trend. The latest data suggest that a \nconsumption recovery is underway and could \nextend into next year. However, China’s decision \nto stick with a zero-COVID strategy could pose  \na risk to a full recovery in consumer activity and \ngrowth, especially against a more complicated \nbackdrop of heightened regulatory uncertainty.16\n\nThough implementing regulations to control  \nrisks is not new in China, the recent crackdown  \nis distinct in its scope. While previous regulatory \ncrackdowns primarily targeted old economy \nsectors, such as industrials and the property \nmarket, the 2021 action was widespread across \nboth old and new economies, affecting close to \n50% of GDP. We believe that this reflects a \nfundamental shift in the govern ment’s policy \ngoals, with the policy priority increasingly shifting \nfrom efficiency to equity and from corporate \nprofitability to labor income. This regulatory \ncampaign is unlikely to stop or reverse, even if the \npace and magnitude may slow slightly in 2022. \nConsequently, we expect a deepening of the \nproperty and energy market downturn in the  \nnear term, as the government seeks to achieve  \nits common prosperity and decarbonization  \ngoals by making housing more affordable and  \nthe power supply more well-rationed. \n\nWe estimate both direct and indirect impacts on \nGDP from a property downturn. Direct effects \ninclude real estate investment and property-\nrelated services and consumption, while indirect \neffects pertain to spillovers into upstream \nindustries, such as materials and metal products, \nthat are highly sensitive to the property activity. \n\nAdditionally, we accounted for potential wealth \neffects coming from a decline in property prices, \nas property accounts for nearly 60% of Chinese \nhouseholds’ wealth, compared with 30% in the \nU.S. (Figure I-23). Our model suggests that the \ntotal drag on growth could be around 2% in 2022, \nwith effects potentially magnified should a déjà \nvu scenario of the 2014–2015 property downturn \nplay out. \n\nFIGURE I-23\nProperty market downturn to deepen in 2022\n\nShare of household wealth\n\n100%\n\nUnited\nStates\n\n30.0%\n\n43.0%\n\n27.0%\n\nChina\n\n59.0%\n\n20.4%\n\n20.5%\n\nHousing\n\nFinancial assets\n\nOther physical assets\n\nDrag on China’s GDP\n\nBaseline\n\n0.9%\n\n0.5%\n\n2.1%\n\n0.4%\n\n0.2%\n\n0.4%\n\n2014–2015\ndéjà vu\n\n1.8%\n\n0.8%\n\n1.1%\n\n4.1%\n\nDirect eﬀects\n\nIndirect eﬀects\n\nResidential\nproperty\ninvestment\n\nProperty\ndevelopment\nand related\nservices\n\nWealth\neﬀect\n\nSpillover\nto other\nindustries\n\nNotes: We consider both real and financial impacts of the property crackdown on \nGDP. In the baseline scenario, we assume growth in property investment declines by \n10 percentage points from high single digits in 2021 to a modest contraction in 2022 \nand growth in property prices moderates by around 5 percentage points. We use \nChina’s input-output table to consider indirect effects such as the spillover impact  \non upstream industries such as materials and metal products, as well as impacts via \nthe wealth effect channel. Under the downside scenario, where we see a replay of  \nthe 2014–2015 property slowdown, we assume growth in property investment  \ndeclines by close to 20 percentage points and growth property prices drop by  \n10 percentage points. \nSources: Vanguard, using data from Refinitiv, the People’s Bank of China, and the \nU.S. Federal Reserve, as of September 30, 2021.\n\n16 \n\nIn contrast with the zero-COVID strategy, the living-with-COVID approach seeks to balance economic and societal concerns while minimizing hospitalizations and deaths, \nwith less focus on the number of infections.\n\n30\n\n\x0cMeanwhile, energy supply shocks as a result of \nthe government’s decarbonization efforts are \nlikely to continue restricting industrial production \nin 2022 in the lead-up to the Winter Olympics and \nthe National Party Congress. These regulatory \nactions will not only directly affect activity and \nemployment in the targeted sectors; they could \nalso dampen overall business confidence and \ninvestment, particularly in the new economy, \nwhich tends to be more sensitive to the regula-\ntory environment (Figure I-24).

By \ncontrast, delayed and insufficient macro easing \ncould well push China’s growth lower than 4%. \nThat said, a hard-landing scenario of the \neconomy appears quite unlikely given the \nsignificant progress made toward addressing \ndemand-side imbalances over the last five years \n(Figure I-25) (Wang, Schickling, and Yeo, 2021). \n\nEngineering a smooth rebalancing in an environ-\nment of shifting policy regimes will require \nprudence to undercut risk but not overstifle \ninnovation, to promote equity but not at the \nexpense of efficiency, and to regulate the private \nsector but not completely revert to a state-\ndominant model. A failure to balance these \nconflicting forces could result in China stagnating \nlike Japan in the longer term, with growth below \n2%.

Although we \nexpect emerging-market growth to outpace  \nthat of its developed-market counterparts, our \nforecast for 7% growth in 2021 and 5.5% in 2022 \nis relatively sluggish given the 2020 downturn in \nemerging markets as well as the pre-COVID \ntrend of growth (Figure I-26). Furthermore, risks \nto our emerging-market growth forecast are \nskewed to the downside, stemming from the \ngrowing potential of earlier-than-expected \ntightening of central bank policy in developed \nmarkets, as well as continued virus vulnerability, \nespecially in emerging-market Asia.\n\n30%\n\n \n\ne\ng\nn\na\nh\nc\ne\ng\na\nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\np\ne\nv\n\n \n\ni\nt\na\n\nl\n\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\n9\n1\n0\n2\n \nr\ne\nb\nm\ne\nc\ne\nD\nm\no\nr\nf\ns\nl\n\n \n\n \n\ne\nv\ne\n\nl\n \n\nP\nD\nG\nn\n\n \n\ni\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n–10\n\nUpside\n\nPre-COVID-19 \ntrend\n\nDownside\n\nBaseline\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\nNotes: The y-axis represents the level impact from the baseline, which is  \nDecember 2019.

We expect \nprogress to continue to be strong in emerging \nAsia and Latin America, such that the majority of \npeople who are willing and able to be vaccinated \nwill be by the end of 2021, ahead of consensus \nexpectations. But vaccine-related health risks \npersist. Logistical and supply factors will limit \nrollout in emerging Africa until at least the first \nhalf of 2022, and vaccine hesitancy will continue \nto hamper vaccine coverage in emerging Europe \nthrough the rest of 2021. With only a small \nproportion of the population having acquired \nimmunity, emerging Asia remains vaccine reliant \nand vulnerable to continued COVID-19 outbreaks. \n\nMoreover, booster shot requirements in developed \nmarkets will chip away at the available pool of \nvaccines, hindering distribution within emerging \nmarkets. \n\nHowever, in good news for emerging-market \nregions outside of Asia, recent evidence seems to \nsuggest that natural immunity is a potent force \nin reducing hospitalization and mortality risk \nfrom subsequent COVID-19 infections. But even \nthough natural immunity may suggest a silver \nlining to the significant outbreaks suffered across \nmuch of emerging markets in 2020 and 2021, \nAsian populations will remain vulnerable until \nvaccination rollouts are complete—and  \npotentially beyond.\n\nFIGURE I-27 \nDivergence in global vaccination rates\n\nPercentage of population fully vaccinated \n\nForecast\n\nLatin \nAmerica\n\nEmerging Asia\n\nDeveloped markets\n\nAfrica\n\nEmerging Europe\n\n100%\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nJun.\n2021\n\nJul.\n2021\n\nAug.\n2021\n\nSep.\n2021\n\nOct.\n2021\n\nNov.\n2021\n\nDec.\n2021\n\nJan.\n2022\n\nFeb.\n2022\n\nMar.\n2022\n\nApr.\n2022\n\nMay\n2022\n\nJun.\n2022\n\nJul.\n2022\n\nNotes: The forecast is based on an AR(1) process assuming a terminal coverage rate and decay factor by region.

We \nestimate that a one-standard-deviation shock  \nto global commodity prices will boost emerging-\nmarket economic growth by 2 percentage points \nover two years. Similarly, we estimate that a \none-standard-deviation appreciation in the dollar  \n(as triggered by an unexpected Fed tightening) \nwill shave off about half a percentage point in \nemerging-market economic growth over two \nyears (Figure I-28).\n\nAn uptick in global demand as countries exit \nlockdown, led by the U.S., has boosted global \ncommodity prices significantly so far this year. \nWe expect supply shortages to continue through \nthe first quarter of 2022 before cooling off \nslightly. In combination with structural energy \nshortages making the extraction of key  \ncommod ities more expensive, and the structural \n\nFIGURE I-28\nCommodity and dollar developments\n\nstep-up in global infrastructure spending to \nretool greener economies, we expect commodity  \nprices to remain elevated in 2022. This is a boost \nto emerging-market economies broadly. Thus \nthere is upside risk to emerging-market growth \nstemming from global commodity demand.\n\nOn the flip side, there is downside risk to our \nemerging-market growth forecast resulting from \nthe increasing potential for earlier-than-expected \nhikes by developed-market central banks, chiefly \nthe Fed. As inflation remains stubbornly high in \nthe U.S., market participants are increasingly \npricing Fed hikes into 2022. This caused sell-offs \nin emerging-market assets in the third quarter  \nof 2021, as evidenced by emerging-market foreign \nexchange markets and by spreads widening. If the \nmarket were to continue to price in earlier Fed \nhikes and possibly even incrementally larger hikes \n(for example, 50 basis points versus 25 basis \npoints), financial conditions may tighten further \nin emerging markets, cutting growth prospects.\n\na.

Figure I-29 \nshows that although developed-market economies \nsuffered no consequences in terms of lower \nforeign exchange rates from fiscal stimulus,  \nthere was a strong positive correlation between \nthe size of fiscal stimulus and the size of the \nsubsequent foreign exchange sell-off in  \nemerging markets. \n\nA depreciating currency in emerging markets  \nis negative for two main reasons: It can be \ninflationary because of the open nature of \n\nemerging-market economies, and it can increase \nthe value of external debt, leading to financial \nstability concerns.17 As an example, we compare \nLatin American economies Mexico and Brazil. \nBrazil stimulated its economy with aggressive \nfiscal spending (similar to developed markets) \nand thereby initially suffered a much milder \nrecession than Mexico, which decided not to \nspend much in the face of the COVID-19 shock. \nHowever, Brazil’s currency has sold off much \nmore severely than the Mexican peso, which \nremains relatively stable. This in turn has led  \nto spiraling inflation in Brazil, compared  \nwith Mexico. \n\nFIGURE I-29\nEmerging-market countries were punished by the markets for fiscal stimulus;  \ndeveloped-market countries were not\n\nSouth Africa\nIndia\n\n–10\n\nMexico\n\nl\n\ni\n\na\nn\nm\no\nn\nn\n\n \n\ni\n \n\n \n\ne\ng\nn\na\nh\nc\ne\ng\na\nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\nP\n\n \n\ne\nc\nn\n\n \n\ni\ns\ne\nt\na\nr\n \ne\ng\nn\na\nh\nc\nx\ne\ne\nv\n\n \n\ni\nt\nc\ne\nﬀ\ne\n\n \n\n0\n2\n0\n2\nf\no\ng\nn\n\n \n\n \n\ni\n\nn\nn\n\ni\n\ng\ne\nb\n\n20%\n\n10\n\n0\n\n–20\n\n–30\n\n–40\n\nRussia\n\nBrazil\n\nTurkey\n\nFrance\n\nAustralia\n\nCanada\n\nU.K.\n\nGermany\n\nJapan\n\nNo negative\nconsequences \nfrom G10 ﬁscal\nspending\n\nThe most ﬁscally\nproﬂigate emerging\nmarkets were \npunished most\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nPercentage change in primary ﬁscal deﬁcit in 2020\n\nNotes: Turkey did very little fiscal stimulus, instead advocating a private credit impulse.

However, in \nemerging Asia, inflation remains below its pre-\nCOVID rate. In 2022, we expect some moderation \nof both phenomena; however, continued global \nsupply disruptions and strong global demand add \nupside risk to our outlook. In particular, we see \nhigher-than-trend inflation continuing in Latin \nAmerica beyond 2022 because of unanchored \nexpectations and policy errors. In contrast,  \nwe expect to see some normalization in  \nemerging Europe and emerging Asia toward  \nthe pre-COVID trend.\n\nPart of the disinflationary pressure in emerging \nAsia stems from its zero-COVID strategies. We \nexpect the pace of vaccine rollout to confer a  \nlevel of herd immunity, such that emerging  \nAsian economies can safely depart from such \napproaches, which have also hampered demand \nin the region. Central banks in regions such as \nLatin America and emerging Europe have been  \nat the forefront of the emerging-market hiking \ncycle and are expected to continue raising rates  \nin 2022. Continued monetary policy efforts to \ncounter inflation in these regions, as well as \ngradually easing global supply constraints and \nwaning developed-market fiscal impulses,  \nshould cool inflationary pressures by late 2022.\n\n37\n\n\x0cII. Global capital markets outlook\n\nGlobal capital markets in 2021 barely missed a \nbeat as they continued their steady rise from \npandemic lows in March 2020. The first quarter \nof 2021 was defined by the “reflation trade” amid \nthe economic reopening that resulted in rising \ninterest rates. The economically sensitive sectors \nof broad markets (value and small-capitalization \nstocks) outperformed. By the second quarter, \nhowever, a more hawkish policy stance from \ncentral banks, falling expectations for global \ngrowth, and the Delta variant caused the yield \ncurve to flatten, U.S. markets to widen their \nperformance gap over international, and growth \nstocks to outperform value. Now, with valuations \nthat have exceeded pre-pandemic highs, elevated \ninflation and the prospect of policy normalization \nare creating a fragile backdrop for markets.\n\nAs we look to 2022 and beyond, our long-term \noutlook for global asset returns is guarded.  \nThis is especially true for equities, where high \nvaluations and lower economic growth rates \nmean we expect lower returns over the next \ndecade. For fixed income, low (by historical \nstandards) interest rates mean that investors \nshould expect lower returns. However, the fact \nthat rates have risen modestly since 2020 means \nthat our outlook is commensurately higher.\n\nVanguard’s distinct approach to forecasting\n\nTo treat the future with the deference it deserves, Vanguard has long believed that market forecasts \nare best viewed in a probabilistic framework. This annual publication’s primary objectives are to \ndescribe the projected long-term return distributions that contribute to strategic asset allocation \ndecisions and to present the rationale for the ranges and probabilities of potential outcomes. This \nanalysis discusses our global outlook from the perspective of a U.S. investor with a dollar-\ndenominated portfolio.\n\n38\n\n\x0cA guarded stance on future returns has been a \ntenet of our 10-year outlooks for the past few \nyears. Figure II-1 shows our 10-year outlook and \nrealized returns for a globally diversified, 60% \nstock/40% bond portfolio since 2001. The figure \nshows how stronger-than-expected equity \nmarkets (especially in the U.S.) have led to high \nreturns for investors. It also shows that our \noutlook for global stocks and bonds has drifted \nlower since the GFC—a move accelerated by \nrecent outperformance. This drift is also a \nfunction of the low-growth, low-inflation \nenvironment that has been a theme of the last \ndecade and has served to keep interest rates low. \nLow rates, in turn, have simultaneously raised \nrealized returns through the valuations channel \n\nand reduced our expectations for the future. This \nis because interest rates on developed-market \nsovereign debt are the foundation on which other, \nrisky returns are built.\n\nAlthough our economic outlook calls for modestly \nhigher inflation and a normalization in interest \nrates over the next decade, it will not be enough \nto raise our returns forecast to historical \naverages. Achieving such returns will require a \nshift in the underlying secular forces that have \nkept rates low across developed economies since \nthe late 2000s.18 For this reason, our confidence \nin our low-return outlook has only grown stronger, \nand we continue to caution investors against \nextrapolating future results from the past.\n\nFIGURE II-1\nReturns on a 60/40 balanced portfolio are expected to be roughly half of what investors \nrealized over the last decade\n\n10-year annualized returns\n\n10%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nInterquartile range\n\nActual return\n\nMedian expectation\n\n2011\n\n2013\n\n2015\n\n2017\n\n2019\n\n2021\n\n2023\n\n2025\n\n2027\n\n2029\n\n2031\n\nPast performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.\nNotes: The chart shows the actual 10-year annualized return of a 60/40 stock/bond portfolio compared with the VCMM forecast for the same portfolio made 10 years earlier.

Figures II-2a and II-2b show that U.S. \nequities have outperformed our forecast, pushing \nour future return expectations lower, while \ninternational equities have underperformed, \npushing expectations higher.\n\nFIGURE II-2 \nValuations are the key driver of U.S. outperformance over the last decade and \nunderperformance over the next\n\na.

For \n\ninstance, a country could lag from a valuation perspective but still outperform as a function of the other return drivers.\n\n16%\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n40\n\n\x0cIn the U.S., valuation changes and, to a lesser \nextent, earnings growth pushed realized  \nreturns 9.4 percentage points higher than our \nexpectations on an annualized basis during the \nlast decade. Figure II-3 compares our forecasted \nreturn for U.S. equities in 2011 with the realized \nreturn as of September 30, 2021—basically the \n2021 data points for each line in Figure II-2a. In \nFigure II-3, “valuation change” is decomposed into \nchanges in real interest rates, long-run inflation, \nand “behavior” (overvaluation). The figure shows \nthat low interest rates and inflation, along with \nhigher-than-expected earnings, justify some, but \nnot all, of the error in our forecast.\n\nIn order for the gap that defined the last  \ndecade to persist into the next, one would have  \nto believe that economic growth will not be \nbroad-based (that is, it will be concentrated in  \na few sectors), that interest rates will decline \nfurther, that inflation pressures will completely \nsubside, and that risk-seeking behavior will \ncontinue to push valuations away from fair value. \nThese assumptions are inconsistent with our \neconomic analysis and the market-based \nexpectations that serve as inputs to our \nVanguard Capital Markets Model (VCMM). \n\nFIGURE II-3\nInvestor psychology and higher earnings explain most of the error in our forecast\n\n2.0%\n\n–0.5%\n\n15.38%\n\n16.82%\n\n16.8%\n\n6.4%\n\n8.95%\n\n20%\n\ns\nn\nr\nu\nt\ne\nr\n \nd\ne\nz\ni\nl\n\na\nu\nn\nn\na\n \nr\na\ne\ny\n-\n0\n1\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n–0%\n\n7.34%\n\n7.4%\n\nPredicted\n\n1.6%\n\n7.34%\n\n–0.1%\n\n7.9%\n\n10-year \nreal yield\n\n10-year annualized\ninﬂation\n\nBehavior\n\nEarnings\n\nDividend\n\nActual\n\nValuation (P/E) change\n\nEarnings growth\n\nDividend\n\nTotal return\n\n2011 forecast\n\nActual 2011–2021\n\n5.0%\n\n7.0%\n\n2.5%\n\n2.0%\n\n7.4%\n\n16.8%\n\nPast performance is not a reliable indicator of future results. \nNotes: The chart decomposes the difference between our 2011 forecast for U.S. equities as of September 30, 2011, and actual returns over the subsequent 10-year period.

The emerging markets, U.S. value, and U.S. small-cap relative valuations \nare based on the relative percentile rank to fair value estimated in Figures II-6 and II-8. The U.S. growth and large-cap valuations are composite valuation measures of the style \nfactor to U.S relative valuations and the current U.S. CAPE percentile relative to its fair-value CAPE. The relative valuation is the current ratio of the style factor to U.S. price/book \nmetrics relative to its historical average from January 1979 through September 2021. For corresponding indexes for the four style factor valuation measures, see the Appendix \nsection “Indexes for VCMM simulations.” The estimates cover the period beginning from January 1940 for the U.S., January 1970 for Australia and the U.K., January 1980 for other \ndeveloped markets, and September 1998 for emerging markets, and ended September 30, 2021. \nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on Robert Shiller’s website, at aida.wss.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Federal Reserve Board, and \nRefinitiv, as of September 30, 2021.\n\n42\n\n\x0cU.S. valuations are being stretched at the \nhighest levels since the early 2000s\nThe continued surge in broad equity markets \nfollowing their robust recovery in 2020 has \npushed Robert Shiller’s cyclically adjusted price/\nearnings ratio (CAPE) for the Standard & Poor’s \n500 Index further above our estimate of fair \nvalue. Figure II-5 shows the CAPE along with our \nfair-value model estimate and suggests that even \nwhen we account for the level of real interest \nrates and inflation, equities have not been this \novervalued since the dot-com bubble.20 The \nvaluation dashboard in Figure II-4b confirms this \nby showing that U.S. equities (led by large-cap \ngrowth) are nearing unprecedented levels of \novervaluation.\n\nThe spread between actual and fair-value CAPE \nis also instructive because of the recent divergence \nin direction between the two series. Over the last \n12 months, higher interest rates and inflation \nhave pushed our estimate of fair value lower, \nwhile market participants have continued to \nexpand valuations. We view this as confirmation \nthat the market sees near-term inflation pressures \nas transitory and unlikely to persist—a view that \nis not certain and will be dependent on successful \ncentral bank policy normalization.\n\nFIGURE II-5 \nU.S. equities have not been this overvalued since the dot-com bubble\n\nFair-value CAPE +/–0.5 standard error\n\nCAPE for the S&P 500 Index\n\nHistorical average\n\nDot-com bubble\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n \n\nd\ne\nt\ns\nu\n\nj\n\nd\na\ny\n\n \n\nl\nl\n\na\nc\ni\nl\nc\ny\nC\n\no\n\ni\nt\na\nr\n \ns\ng\nn\n\ni\n\nn\nr\na\ne\n/\ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n\n0\n1950\n\n1960\n\n1970\n\n1980\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\n2020\n\nPast performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.\nNotes: The U.S. fair-value CAPE is based on a statistical model that corrects CAPE measures for the level of inflation and interest rates. The statistical model specification is \na three-variable vector error correction, including equity-earnings yields, 10-year trailing inflation, and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields estimated over the period January 1940 to \nSeptember 2021. Details were published in the 2017 Vanguard research paper Global Macro Matters: As U.S. Stock Prices Rise, the Risk-Return Trade-Off Gets Tricky (Davis, 2017).  \nA declining fair-value CAPE suggests that higher equity risk premium (ERP) compensation is required, while a rising fair-value CAPE suggests that the ERP is compressing.\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on data from Robert Shiller’s website, at aida.wss.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Federal Reserve \nBoard, Refinitiv, and Global Financial Data, as of September 30, 2021.\n\n20  Our fair-value CAPE is at the 94th percentile of historical deviations from fair value since 1950 as of September 30, 2021.\n\n43\n\n\x0cStill-stretched valuations are an important input \ninto our more conservative forecast for U.S. \nequity over the next 10 years. Although valuation \nexpansion proved to be a tailwind to returns over \nthe last 30 years, we expect valuations to contract \n3.2% on average annually as interest rates \ngradually rise over the next decade. Alongside  \nthe decline in corporate earnings growth, which  \nis projected to fall from its 7% average annual \nrate over the last decade to a rate close to 5%, \nour expected return outlook for U.S. equities  \nover the next decade is centered in the modest \n2.3%–4.3% range, lower than the 3.5%–5.5% \nreturns forecasted last year.21 This pales in \ncomparison with the 10.6% annualized return \ngenerated over the last 30 years. \n\nWithin the U.S. market, we continue to have a \nconstructive view on value stocks despite their \nstrong performance relative to growth in 2021 \n(DiCiurcio et al., 2021). As Figure II-6a illustrates, \nresults through September 30, 2021, show that \nvalue has recovered only about a quarter of its \nnearly unprecedented deficit. We expect value  \nto outperform by as much as the historical  \nequity risk premium over the next decade,  \nmostly because of a decay in the overvaluation  \nof growth stocks, not because the “fair value  \nof value” has returned to historical norms. \n\nWe find that similar drivers—interest rates, \ninflation, volatility, and corporate profits—explain \n72% of the variations in small-cap versus large-\ncap price/book ratios (Figure II-6b). However, the \nresurgence in economically sensitive parts of the \nmarket, such as small-caps, has been sufficient  \nto return that ratio to our estimate of fair value. \nBut as inflation pressures continue to mount, the \nrisk for small-caps is that higher growth does not \ncontinue to accompany price increases, as it has \nover the past year.\n\n21 \n\nInvestors should recognize that “low return” does not necessarily imply negative returns. Although the probability of negative returns on U.S. equities over the next decade is \nhigher than it was last year, the central tendency of our forecast is still positive. If our forecast is correct, the U.S. stock market could continue to reach all-time highs, albeit at \na slower rate.\n\n44\n\n\x0c0.35\n\n0.30\n\n0.25\n\n0.20\n\n0.15\n\n0.10\n\n0.05\n\n0\n1979\n\n1.4\n\n1.2\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n \n\nk\no\no\nb\n/\ne\nc\ni\nr\np\nh\nt\nw\no\nr\ng\no\nt\nk\no\no\nb\n/\ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nl\n\ne\nu\na\nv\nf\no\no\ni\nt\na\nR\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nk\no\no\nb\n/\ne\nc\ni\nr\np\nt\ne\nk\nr\na\nm\no\nt\nk\no\no\nb\n/\ne\nc\ni\nr\np\nk\nc\no\nt\ns\n \nl\nl\n\n \n\n \n\na\nm\ns\nf\no\no\n\n \n\n \n\ni\nt\na\nR\n\nFIGURE II-6 \nValue and small-caps outperformed broad U.S. indexes this year\n\na.

Despite the global divergence in health and \neconomic outcomes, we believe that there is a \nhigh probability that international equities will \n\noutperform U.S. equities in the coming decades. \nThis view, highlighted in Figure II-7, is largely \nbecause of reversion in the unsustainable U.S. \nvaluation expansion described above, but it is  \nnot conditional on it. Our analysis suggests that \neven if interest rates remain low 10 years from \nnow—which would provide support for equity \nvaluations—they will likely be associated with \noffsetting lower economic and earnings growth \nover the same period (DiCiurcio et al., 2020). \n\nFIGURE II-7\nValuation contraction in the U.S. is expected to drive excess returns internationally \nover the next 10 years\n\nAnnualized return\n\n1.5%\n\n0.6%\n\n1.5%\n\n–0.7%\n\n6.2%\n\n3.3%\n\nMSCI USA\nreturn\n(2021–2031)\n\nValuation\nchange\n\nEarnings\ngrowth\n\nDividend\nyield\n\nValuation \nexpansion\n\nEarnings \ngrowth\n\n–3.2%\n\n–1.7%\n\n5.0%\n\n4.3%\n\nDividend \nyield\n\n1.5%\n\n3.0%\n\nForeign-\nexchange\nreturn\n\nForeign- \nexchange \nreturn\n\n—\n\n0.6%\n\nMSCI ACWI\nex USA return\n(2021–2031)\n\nTotal return\n\n3.3%\n\n6.2%\n\nMSCI USA Index\n\nMSCI ACWI ex USA Index\n\nAny projections should be regarded as hypothetical in nature and do not reflect or guarantee future results.\nNotes: Forward-looking return estimates are from the VCMM, as of September 30, 2021, for the period October 1, 2021, through September 30, 2031.

The combined pressures of \nCOVID-19 and the reduced ability to provide \npolicy support have hurt emerging markets on a \nrelative basis. However, lower relative valuations \nand anticipation of increased global demand  \nhave made emerging-market equities attractive \nto some. \n\nOur research indicates that the broad  \nemerging-market valuation is stretched based  \non its relationships with aggregate inflation,  \nreal U.S. short-term yields, the spread between \nemerging-market and U.S. central bank policy \nrates, economic conditions, and equity market \nvolatility.22 Together, these drivers explain about \n\ntwo-thirds of emerging-market valuations, which \nin turn explain future emerging-market equity \nreturns.23 Figure II-8 shows our estimate of fair \nvalue and actual results, and highlights that \nemerging-market valuations are most sensitive  \nto the economic environment.\n\nAlthough we view valuations as stretched in \nemerging markets, it does not necessarily mean \nwe believe that investors should avoid these \nmarkets. In fact, current valuations and a \ncorrection to fair value suggest that emerging-\nmarket returns should be 4.2%–6.2% per year  \n(1.9 percentage points higher than U.S. equities) \nover the next decade. Emerging markets also \nhave a historically moderate correlation with  \nU.S. and developed-market international \nequities.24 For these reasons, we believe that \nemerging-market equities still merit inclusion  \nin a globally diversified portfolio.\n\nFIGURE II-8 \nEmerging markets present opportunities when economic fundamentals are pointing up\n\no\ni\nt\na\nr\n \n \n\n \n\n3\nE\n/\nP\ns\nt\ne\nk\nr\na\nm\ng\nn\ng\nr\ne\nm\nE\n\ni\n\n \n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n+/–0.5 standard error\n\nMSCI Emerging Markets P/E3 ratio (actual)\n\nMSCI Emerging Markets P/E3 ratio (predicted)\n\n1998\n\n2000\n\n2002\n\n2004\n\n2006\n\n2008\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\n2014\n\n2016\n\n2018\n\n2020\n\nNotes: The statistical model specification is a five-variable ordinary least squares regression that uses the following variables: inflation for six major emerging markets (Brazil, \nChina, India, South Korea, Mexico, and Taiwan) weighted by MSCI monthly index weights; monthly average of daily real 10-year U.S. Treasury yield; emerging markets central bank \npolicy rates weighted by GDP in U.S. dollars; Vanguard’s leading economic indicators (VLEI) for China, Brazil, and Mexico (weighted average based on country GDP in U.S. dollars);  \nand monthly average of daily U.S. equity market volatility (VIX).

Our research suggests that \nthis discrepancy between actual yields and our \nestimate of fair value is the result of the long  \nend of the curve being constrained by strong \ninvestor demand. \n\nOur fair-value framework estimates the fair  \nvalue of the yield curve based on the fundamental \ndrivers of Treasury yields (Figure II-11), such as \n\nFederal Reserve policy rates and the long-term \ngrowth and inflation environments. Although this \napproach suggests that the long end of the yield \ncurve is overvalued, our research suggests that \nthe current deviation can be explained by supply \nand demand considerations observed from the \ndistribution of yields from primary Treasury \nauctions. Since bottoming in July, the rise in \ninterest rates toward fundamental fair value has \ncoincided with reduced demand. As of the end of \nSeptember, the short end (illustrated by the 2- \nand 5-year key rates in Figure II-11) is close to fair \nvalue, while the long end (represented by the \n10- and 30-year key rates in Figure II-11) is about \na 0.5 standard deviation below fair value.25 \nLooking over a 10-year time horizon, we expect \nrising rates to produce a 1.2%–2.2% annualized \nreturn on 10-year U.S. Treasuries.\n\nFIGURE II-11 \nYields are rising, but our fair-value framework supports historically low levels\n\nThe short end of the U.S. yield curve is closer to our estimate of fair value than the long end\n\n3.5%\n\ns\nd\n\nl\n\ne\n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\ny\nd\nn\no\nb\nt\nn\ne\nm\nn\nr\ne\nv\no\nG\n\n3.0\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\nPredicted\nrange\n\nMedian\nyield curve\nfair value\n\nActual\nyield curve\n\nSeptember\n2020 yields\n\n2-year\n\n5-year\n\n10-year\n\n30-year\n\nNotes: The chart shows the actual constant-maturity interest rate for U.S. government bonds at four points on the yield curve and our estimate of fair value. Fair value is derived \nfrom a statistical model specification that is a five-variable vector error correction, including the key rate yield on the Treasury yield curve (at 2 years, 5 years, 10 years, and 30 \nyears); the first three principal components of covariance matrix for the following four variables: 10-year trailing inflation, 10-year trailing food inflation, 10-year trailing hourly \nearnings growth, and effective Fed funds rate; and the five-year trailing real GDP estimated over the period January 1979–September 2021.\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on data from FactSet, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Federal Reserve Board, Refinitiv, and Global Financial Data, as of  \nSeptember 30, 2021.\n\n25  Because bond prices and yields move in opposite directions, when actual yields are below our fair-value estimates, it indicates that those bonds are expensive. This is in \n\ncontrast to equities (value/growth and emerging markets), which are considered “undervalued” when below our fair-value estimate.\n\n50\n\n\x0cCorporate bonds: Higher risk, higher return\nFed policy has played a similar, albeit indirect,  \nrole in supporting the corporate bond market. \nRising long-term Treasury rates have raised our \ncentral tendency for U.S. credit bond returns \ncompared with last year, to the 1.6%–2.6%  \nrange. Our outlook suggests that the expected \nrisk premium associated with credit bonds is \novervalued (Figure II-10b). Within the U.S. \naggregate bond market, investors are still \nexpected to be compensated for assuming  \ncredit risk, though by about half as much as we \nsuggested in 2020, resulting from continued \ntightening in credit spreads. High-yield credit has \noutperformed investment-grade credit over the \nlast year because of tightening spreads. This has \nled us to lower our return outlook for high yield  \nto the 2.2% to 3.2% range. \n\nTreasury Inflation-Protected Securities \n(TIPS): Less attractive than last year\nLast year, our outlook identified the risk that \ngrowth/inflation surges because of base effects \nor optimism driven by health outcomes could \nwarrant some Treasury Inflation-Protected \nSecurities (TIPS) exposure. TIPS-implied inflation \nexpectations did surge throughout the first half \nof 2021 and have since moderated to settle above \nthe Fed’s 2% inflation target and the VCMM  \nlong-term median levels. Further, the prospect  \nof rising real rates due to central bank tightening \nmay reduce the attractiveness of TIPS from a \nreturn perspective relative to a year ago, but we \nstill believe they could be a valuable inflation \nhedge for some institutions and investors \n\nsensitive to inflation risk. Although our economic \noutlook suggests that inflation is unlikely to \npersist at current levels, our research suggests \nthat moderately higher inflation because of fiscal \nspending and rising expectations is possible \n(Sathe, Wieland, and Davis, 2021). \n\nMortgage-backed securities: Negative  \ncorrelation with equities, but higher yield  \nthan Treasuries\nThe low-return environment in fixed income \nmeans that bonds are expected to add relatively \nlittle to the returns from a multi-asset portfolio. \nThe negative, long-term correlation with \nequities—especially in times of acute market \nstress—still warrants bonds’ inclusion, but \ninvestors are right to worry about their impact  \non return.26 This reinforces our view from last \nyear’s outlook that the role of bonds is primarily \nas a “shock absorber” in a portfolio. Mortgage-\nbacked securities (MBS) offer investors a \npremium over Treasuries as compensation for \nbearing interest-rate volatility risk.27 Over  \n10 years, we expect MBS to yield 1.7%–2.7%, \ncompared with 1.2%–2.2% for Treasuries  \n(Figure II-10a), representing a historically low  \n(but still positive) premium of 50 basis points. \nFurther, the historical correlation of MBS with \nbroad U.S. equities is –0.4, similar to that of  \nTreasuries. For investors looking to add yield  \nwhile maintaining the diversification benefit  \nof government bonds, MBS could be an option.\n\n26  Even in the midst of the pandemic, when equity and bond correlations were briefly positive, less negative returns from fixed income still helped offset some of the losses in a \n\nbalanced portfolio’s equity holdings.\n\n27  MBS are much more sensitive to large changes in interest rates than Treasuries are. This is especially true in a rising interest-rate environment where MBS prices will decline at \n\nan increasing rate. However, when interest rates fall, MBS prices do not rise as much as Treasury bonds of a similar duration.\n\n51\n\n\x0cStock/bond correlations: Inflation needs \nto run hotter for long-term correlations \nto flip positive\n\nThe prospect of higher inflation has led some to \nquestion whether the diversification benefit of \nbonds, a key component of multi-asset portfolio \nconstruction over the past 20 years, will persist. \nThe logic underpinning this argument is that \nrising inflation will raise interest rates, which \nsimultaneously causes bond and equity prices to \nfall. Our research finds that although short-term \n\ncorrelations can vary significantly, longer-term \nmeasures have remained negative (Figure II-12). \nFurther, we find that inflation is a key driver  \nof long-term correlation, but we would need \nsignificantly higher inflation (5.7%) than our  \nbase case (2%) over the next five years to see \ncorrelations become meaningfully positive  \n(Wu et al., 2021). For investors looking to achieve \ntheir long-term goals, overall asset allocation is \nstill the most important driver of portfolio \noutcomes over long time horizons.\n\nFIGURE II-12 \nShort-term correlation is time-varying, though regimes tend to stick for years\n\nn\no\n\ni\nt\na\n\nl\n\ne\nr\nr\no\nC\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n–0.2\n\n–0.4\n\n–0.6\n\n–0.8\n\n–1\n\n60-day\nrolling correlation\n\n24-month\nrolling correlation\n\n1992\n\n1999\n\n2006\n\n2013\n\n2020\n\nPast performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.\nNote: Rollling correlations are calculated on total returns of the S&P 500 Index and the S&P U.S. Treasury Bond Current 10-Year Index, using daily return data for the period \nbetween January 1, 1990, and September 30, 2021. \nSources: Vanguard, using data from Refinitiv, as of September 30, 2021. \n\n52\n\n\x0cA balanced portfolio for a more  \nbalanced environment \n\nAs policymakers look to strike a better balance  \nin the years ahead, investors would be well- \nserved to remember the same principles when \nconstructing their portfolios. Figure II-13a \nexamines three possible economic scenarios \noccurring over the next five years. The downside \nscenario depicts an economic environment of \nbelow-trend economic growth, with inflation \nstaying above trend. The baseline scenario is \ndefined by above-trend growth and inflation.  \nThe upside scenario is characterized by higher-\nthan-expected growth, with inflation falling \nbelow trend. \n\nFigure II-13a also shows optimal portfolios  \nbased on our five-year return projections for  \neach scenario that vary their exposures to the \nfollowing four factors, or risk premia: equity  \nrisk premium, credit risk premium, inflation  \nrisk premium, and term premium. In the upside \nscenario, expected global equity returns would  \nbe high. This risk-on environment would also be \nbeneficial for credit fixed income, while lower \ndiversification benefits coming from commodities \nand TIPS would be expected, as inflation risk is \ncontained. \n\nIn the downside scenario, the portfolio would \nunderweight equity (20% less equity exposure \nthan a 60/40 policy portfolio) and credit, and  \nit would increase exposure to international \n(hedged) bonds for additional diversification. \nAllocation to commodities and short-term  \nTIPS also would be higher, to hedge short-term \ninflation risk. \n\nThe portfolio strategy in our baseline scenario  \nis well diversified, with a small underweight to \nrisky assets compared with a 60/40 portfolio.  \nAs asset return expectations materially change \nthrough time, the asset allocation in our baseline \nscenario also changes accordingly. These changing \nasset expectations drive time-varying portfolios. \nOur research suggests that investors who have \nthe willingness and ability to accept forecast \nmodel risk may be able to improve risk-adjusted \nreturns over the long term relative to a static \nportfolio (Wallick et al., 2020).\n\nUsing our VCMM simulations, we are able not \nonly to illustrate the effectiveness of various \nportfolio strategies designed for each scenario \nbut also to show the risks of such strategies \n(Figure II-13b). The following conclusions can be \ndrawn from our analysis:\n\n1.  Portfolios designed for specific macroeconomic \nscenarios entail important trade-offs. If the \nscenario for which the portfolio was designed \ndoes not take place, then the portfolio \nperformance is typically the worst of all the \noptions. \n\n2. A balanced portfolio works well for investors \nwho are agnostic about the future state of \nthe economy. The baseline balanced portfolio \nis an “all-weather” strategy, with either top \nor middle-of-the-road performance in each \nscenario. \n\n3. Portfolio tilts should be done within an \n\noptimization framework. Ad hoc tilts ignore \ncorrelations among assets and are likely  \nto lead to inefficient portfolios (Aliaga-Díaz  \net al., 2019).\n\n53\n\n\x0cFIGURE II-13 \nCyclical surprises and asset allocation trade-offs\n\na. \nOptimal portfolios \nvary for different \neconomic  \nenvironments.\n\nScenario 1 \n\nBaseline\n\nScenario 2 \n\nDownside\n\nScenario 3 \n\nUpside\n\nAbove-trend growth \nand inflation\n\nBelow-trend growth and \nabove-trend inflation\n\nAbove-trend growth and \nbelow-trend inflation\n\n23%\n35%\n  10%\n  13%\n0%\n13%\n6%\n\nU.S. equity\nGlobal ex-U.S. equity\nCommodities\nGlobal ex-U.S. bonds\nShort-term TIPS\nLong-term Treasury\nShort-term credit\n\n16%\n24%\n  15%\n  12%\n  10%\n23%\n  0%\n\nU.S. equity\nGlobal ex-U.S. equity\nCommodities\nGlobal ex-U.S. bonds\nShort-term TIPS\nLong-term Treasury\nShort-term credit\n\n32%\n48%\n4%\n5%\n0%\n5%\n6%\n\nU.S. equity\nGlobal ex-U.S. equity\nCommodities\nGlobal ex-U.S. bonds\nShort-term TIPS\nLong-term Treasury\nShort-term credit\n\nb.   \nThe baseline \nportfolio is not \nalways the best, \nbut it’s never the \nworst.\n\nn\nr\nu\nt\ne\nr\n \nd\ne\nz\ni\nl\n\na\nu\nn\nn\na\nn\na\n\n \n\ni\n\nd\ne\nM\n\n6%\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16%\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16%\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16%\n\nBest\n\nSecond best\n\nWorst\n\nBaseline \n\nDownside\n\nUpside\n\nMedian volatility\n\nDownside\n\nBaseline \n\nUpside\n\nUpside\n\nBaseline \n\nDownside\n\nNotes: Performance is relative to the efficient frontier.

Appendix \n\nAbout the Vanguard Capital Markets Model \n\nIMPORTANT: The projections and other \ninformation generated by the Vanguard Capital \nMarkets Model regarding the likelihood of various \ninvestment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, \ndo not reflect actual investment results, and are \nnot guarantees of future results. VCMM results \nwill vary with each use and over time.\n\nThe VCMM projections are based on a statistical \nanalysis of historical data. Future returns may \nbehave differently from the historical patterns \ncaptured in the VCMM. More important, the \nVCMM may be underestimating extreme \nnegative scenarios unobserved in the historical \nperiod on which the model estimation is based.\n\nThe VCMM is a proprietary financial simulation \ntool developed and maintained by Vanguard’s \nInvestment Strategy Group. The model forecasts \ndistributions of future returns for a wide array of \nbroad asset classes. Those asset classes include \nU.S. and international equity markets, several \nmaturities of the U.S. Treasury and corporate \nfixed income markets, international fixed income \nmarkets, U.S. money markets, commodities, and \ncertain alternative investment strategies. The \ntheoretical and empirical foundation for the \nVanguard Capital Markets Model is that the \nreturns of various asset classes reflect the \ncompensation investors require for bearing \ndifferent types of systematic risk (beta). At the \ncore of the model are estimates of the dynamic \nstatistical relationship between risk factors and \nasset returns, obtained from statistical analysis \nbased on available monthly financial and \neconomic data. Using a system of estimated \nequations, the model then applies a Monte Carlo \nsimulation method to project the estimated \ninterrelationships among risk factors and asset \nclasses as well as uncertainty and randomness \n\nover time. The model generates a large set of \nsimulated outcomes for each asset class over \nseveral time horizons. Forecasts are obtained  \nby computing measures of central tendency  \nin these simulations. Results produced by the  \ntool will vary with each use and over time.\n\nThe primary value of the VCMM is in its \napplication to analyzing potential client \nportfolios. VCMM asset-class forecasts—\ncomprising distributions of expected returns, \nvolatilities, and correlations—are key to the \nevaluation of potential downside risks, various \nrisk–return trade-offs, and the diversification \nbenefits of various asset classes. Although \ncentral tendencies are generated in any return \ndistribution, Vanguard stresses that focusing  \non the full range of potential outcomes for the \nassets considered, such as the data presented  \nin this paper, is the most effective way to use \nVCMM output. We encourage readers interested \nin more details of the VCMM to read Vanguard’s \nwhite paper (Davis et al., 2014).\n\nThe VCMM seeks to represent the uncertainty  \nin the forecast by generating a wide range of \npotential outcomes. It is important to recognize \nthat the VCMM does not impose “normality” on \nthe return distributions, but rather is influenced \nby the so-called fat tails and skewness in the \nempirical distribution of modeled asset-class \nreturns. Within the range of outcomes, individual \nexperiences can be quite different, underscoring \nthe varied nature of potential future paths. \nIndeed, this is a key reason why we approach \nasset-return outlooks in a distributional \nframework.\n\n56\n\n\x0cIndexes for VCMM simulations\n\nThe long-term returns of our hypothetical portfolios are based on data for the appropriate \nmarket indexes through September 30, 2021. We chose these benchmarks to provide the \nmost complete history possible, and we apportioned the global allocations to align with \nVanguard’s guidance in constructing diversified portfolios. Asset classes and their \nrepresentative forecast indexes are as follows:\n\n•  U.S. equities: MSCI US Broad Market Index.\n\n•  Global ex-U.S. equities: MSCI All Country World ex USA Index. \n\n•  U.S. REITs: FTSE/NAREIT US Real Estate Index.\n\n•  U.S. cash: U.S. 3-Month Treasury—constant maturity.\n\n•  U.S. Treasury bonds: Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Index.\n\n•  U.S. short-term Treasury bonds: Bloomberg U.S. 1–5 Year Treasury Bond Index.\n\n•  U.S. long-term Treasury bonds: Bloomberg U.S. Long Treasury Bond Index.\n\n•  U.S. credit bonds: Bloomberg U.S. Credit Bond Index.\n\n•  U.S. short-term credit bonds: Bloomberg U.S. 1–3 Year Credit Bond Index.\n\n•  U.S. high-yield corporate bonds: Bloomberg U.S. High Yield Corporate Bond Index.\n\n•  U.S. bonds: Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.\n\n•  Global ex-U.S. bonds: Bloomberg Global Aggregate ex-USD Index.\n\n•  U.S. TIPS: Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities Index.\n\n•  U.S. short-term TIPS: Bloomberg U.S. 1–5 Year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities Index.\n\n•  Emerging-market sovereign bonds: Bloomberg Emerging Markets USD Aggregate Bond Index\n\n•  Commodities: Bloomberg Commodity Index.\n\n•  Mortgage-backed securities (MBS): Bloomberg U.S. Mortgage Backed Securities Index.\n\nAll equity indexes below are weighted by market capitalization:\n\n•  Small-cap equities: Stocks with a market cap in the lowest two-thirds of the Russell 1000 Index.\n\n•  Large-cap equities: Stocks with a market cap in the highest two-thirds of the Russell 1000 Index.\n\n•  Growth equities: Stocks with a price/book ratio in the highest one-third of the Russell 1000 Index.\n\n•  Value equities: Stocks with a price/book ratio in the lowest one-third of the Russell 1000 Index.\n\n57\n\n\x0cNotes on risk\n\nAll investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Past performance is \nno guarantee of future returns. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a \ndeclining market. There is no guarantee that any particular asset allocation or mix of funds will meet \nyour investment objectives or provide you with a given level of income. The performance of an index \nis not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\n\nStocks of companies in emerging markets are generally more risky than stocks of companies in \ndeveloped countries. U.S. government backing of Treasury or agency securities applies only to the \nunderlying securities and does not prevent price fluctuations. Investments that concentrate on a \nrelatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher price volatility. Investments in stocks issued  \nby non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk and currency risk.\n\nBond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time, and that bond \nprices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer’s ability to \nmake payments. High-yield bonds generally have medium- and lower-range credit-quality ratings  \nand are therefore subject to a higher level of credit risk than bonds with higher credit-quality ratings. \nAlthough the income from U.S. Treasury obligations held in the fund is subject to federal income tax, \nsome or all of that income may be exempt from state and local taxes.\n\n58\n\n\x0cConnect with Vanguard®\nglobal.vanguard.com\n\nInvestment risk information\n\nThe value of investments, and the income from them, may fall or rise and investors may get back \nless than they invested.\n\nPast performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.\n\nSimulated past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.\n\nAny projections should be regarded as hypothetical in nature and do not reflect or guarantee \nfuture results.\n\nImportant information\n\nFor professional investors only (as defined under the MiFID II Directive) investing for \ntheir own account (including management companies (fund of funds) and \nprofessional clients investing on behalf of their discretionary clients).

U.S.  \nreal growth has slowed to a still-robust \nrate of 2.7% on a year-over-year basis. \nInflation has eased to 2.7%,1 and \nexcluding housing it is even lower at \n2.1%. While inflation still remains above \nthe Federal Reserve’s 2% goal, it has \neased enough to allow the Fed to start \ncutting its policy rate.\n\nFor 2025, we are focused on three \npotential scenarios for the U.S. economy. \nOur base case scenario remains a Soft \nLanding, wherein economic growth \nsettles slightly below that of 2024, \ninflation eases further toward 2% and \nthe Fed proceeds with a gradual pace \nof rate cuts. Our emphasis on this \nscenario reflects our view that consumer \nspending — which represents around \n70% of the economy — will slow from \nstrong gains in 2024 but remain healthy \nin 2025, as growth in real disposable \nincome will likely be supported by \nfavorable labor market conditions and \nfalling inflation. Regarding inflation,  \nwe see scope for increases in services \nprices to soften as wage gains ease \nand housing prices moderate.\n\nWe considered two alternative scenarios \nthat, in our view, reflect key uncertainties \naround the outlook for the U.S. economy \nin the year ahead, particularly regarding \n\nthe economic effects of the likely policy \ninitiatives of the incoming administration. \nWe call these two alternative scenarios \nReflation and Supply Restraint. In all  \nof our three scenarios, we assume that \nthe new administration implements  \na combination of restrictive immigration \npolicies, higher tariffs, income tax cuts \nand a push toward deregulation. In the \nSoft Landing scenario, we assumed that \nthis policy mix has no discernible effect  \non inflation.\n\nHowever, in both the Reflation and \nSupply Restraint scenarios, we assume \nthat the new policies temporarily bring \nthe disinflationary process to a halt \nduring the first half of 2025, leading  \nthe Federal Reserve to pause its rate-\ncutting cycle for most of the year. \nWhere the two alternative scenarios \ndiffer is mainly on the net effect of the \nnew policies on economic activity. In \nthe Reflation scenario, we assume a  \nnet stimulative effect, with growth \nremaining above trend for most  \nof 2025. In contrast, in the Supply \nRestraint scenario, the effect of \nrestrictive immigration policies and \nhigher tariffs leads to supply-side \ndisruptions that could culminate in a \nrecession that starts in late 2025 and \naggressive Fed rate cuts.\n\n1 Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

However, business \nspending remains robust and positive \nreal wage growth has supported \nconsumer spending.\n\nWe may see some moderation of the \nlabor force, but it appears resilient for \nnow, with unemployment at a low of \n6.3%.2 Inflation has returned to the \nEuropean Central Bank's target of 2.0%,3 \nthough services and core inflation sit  \nat higher levels. In addition to fiscal \nconsolidation being a potential drag  \non growth, external shocks such as the \nrisks of an increase in trade barriers \nand of further geopolitical tensions are \nlikely to also drag on the large export \nsector and growth, in general. With \nregard to the U.K., we have a more \nbalanced outlook. The government’s \nbudget may be slightly reflationary,  \nso we expect the Bank of England  \nto maintain a gradual and cautious \napproach to rate cuts. \n\nAmong Asian nations, the outlook  \nfor China remains a central concern. \nEconomic growth is falling short of  \nthe government’s 5% target. Domestic \n\nconsumption remains muted as the \nconsumer faces a falling property \nmarket and high youth unemployment \n(see exhibit). Manufacturing and \nexports have softened and face the \nincreasing risk of tariffs. A slowing \neconomy is deepening a deflationary \nloop, with consumer price inflation only \nslightly above zero and producer prices \ndeep into deflation. Investors cheered \nthe coordinated monetary and fiscal \npolicy support in China, but the \ngovernment has yet to announce  \nfull details. Amid a favorable growth \noutlook in Asia, China’s prospects are \nthe least favorable.\n\nJapan continued on its own path in \n2024 — moving to raise rates and exit  \na decade-plus of negative-rate policy \nduring a time when a number of major \ndeveloped market central banks were \ncutting rates. Economic growth in  \n2024 was unspectacular with sluggish \nconsumption a headwind early on, \ndespite some subsequent improvement. \nHowever, wage gains are spreading \nacross the economy with a robust  \n2024 outcome for wages and a similar \noutlook for 2025. This bodes well for \nconsumption down the road. Still, \nlonger term growth headwinds  \nremain in terms of demographics  \nand productivity. We think the Bank  \nof Japan will look to continue raising \nrates but will have to monitor a number \nof potential crosswinds.\n\n2 Source: FactSet, unemployment is for September 2024. 3 Source: FactSet, most recent inflation \nis the Consumer Price Index as of October 2024.\n\nx\ne\nd\nn\n\ni\n \n\ne\nc\nn\ne\nd\nﬁ\nn\no\nc\n \nr\ne\nm\nu\ns\nn\no\nC\n\n130\n\n120\n\n110\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\nEXHIBIT 2\n\nChina’s Domestic Consumption Faces Headwind of  \nFalling Real Estate\n\nChina Consumer Confidence and Home Prices\n\n Consumer confidence index (left axis) \n Home price changes year-over-year (%, right axis)\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n-15\n\n \n\n \n\nH\no\nm\ne\np\nr\ni\nc\ne\nc\nh\na\nn\ng\ne\ny\n/\ny\n \n(\n\n \n\n%\n\n)\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022 2023 2024\n\nSources: Northern Trust Asset Management, Bloomberg, NBS.

Analysts \nexpect sales to grow at a 6% clip over \nthe next two years. Profit margins (see \nexhibit) have been expanding at a \nrelatively steady pace. We expect this \ntrend to not only continue but possibly \naccelerate due to productivity gains \nfrom the adoption of artificial \nintelligence, declining interest rates  \nand an extension of (and possibly \nadditional) tax cuts under President-\nelect Donald Trump’s administration. \n\nStrong sales growth plus increasing \nmargins leads to positive expectations \nfor earnings. Analyst estimates show \n14% earnings growth for the next year6 \nand 13% for the following year. At \ntoday’s equity prices, these earnings \ngains suggest a forward price-to-\nexpected-earnings ratio closer to \n18, which is more reasonable and \nsustainable. While we anticipate some \nmodest multiple contraction in the \n\ncoming years, we are constructive on \nU.S. large cap equities and feel earnings \ngrowth will outpace any multiple decline.\n\nOf course, U.S. large cap equities  \nare increasingly dominated by a  \nsmall handful of technology and \ncommunication services companies. \nWhile higher market concentration is \nsynonymous with lower diversification \nand higher risk, the current market \nlooks nothing like that of the dot-com \nbubble of the late 1990s. Today, the \nbiggest technology companies have \namong the highest earnings growth, \nprofit margins, capital expenditures \nand free cash flow generation in the \nS&P 500 Index. While they also have \nhigher price-to-earnings ratios, we feel \nthese multiples are justified by strong \nfundamentals. Still, these elevated prices \nput a limit on future gains and we don’t \nexpect a repeat of the last two years.\n\nU.S. small cap returns have been \nsomewhat more modest at 10% this \nyear through October after a 16% gain \nin 2023.7 While strong economic growth \nshould also elevate small caps, we think \ndeclining interest rates will further aid \nperformance as about half of small cap \ndebt is floating interest rate. Lower \nrates may expand margins and \nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s  \nre-shoring efforts will likely boost \nearnings. These, combined with \nreasonable valuations, leads us to be \nconstructive on U.S. small caps as well.\n\n16\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n1991\n\nEXHIBIT 3\n\nRising Profit Margins \n\nAverage Profit Margin of Companies in the S&P 500 Index (%)\n Trend line\n\n Profit margin (%)     \n\n1995\n\n1999\n\n2003\n\n2007\n\n2011\n\n2015\n\n2019\n\n2023\n\nSources: Northern Trust, Bloomberg.

Sector weights alone \nexplain about half the differences in \nperformance since 2009. \n\nSecond, economic growth has been \nlower in developed ex-U.S. countries \nthan in the U.S. For example, the exhibit \ndetails the trend in growth for the U.S. \nand the euro area. In 2009 these two \nregions were nearly at parity but since \nthen the U.S. has grown at double the \nrate of the euro area, largely mirroring \nequity returns. Further, the rate at which \neconomic growth has translated to \nrevenue growth has been significantly \ndifferent between these two regions.\n\nIn 2025, declining global interest rates \nmay favor sectors more prevalent in \ndeveloped ex-U.S. benchmarks but we \nexpect economic growth differences to \npersist. While developed ex-U.S. price-\nto-earnings multiples look attractive \nfrom a historical perspective, we don’t \nexpect near-term expansion given  \nthe slower growth outlook. We do \nanticipate some margin expansion \nfrom artificial intelligence and lower \ninterest rates, but not enough on \nbalance to offset low revenue \nexpectations. So we continue to  \nexpect that developed ex-U.S. large \ncap stocks will continue to trail U.S. \nlarge caps. That said, developed  \nex-U.S. can play an important portfolio \ndiversification role, given their very \ndifferent sector profile and interest  \nrate sensitivity that can help manage \nrisks from a highly concentrated U.S. \nequity market. \n\n30\n\n26\n\n22\n\n18\n\n14\n\n10\n\nEXHIBIT 4\n\nU.S. Economy Has Outpaced Europe\n\nGross Domestic Product ($ trillions)\n Euro area\n\n U.S.     \n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\nSource: Bloomberg.

First, from a valuation \nperspective, emerging market \ncompanies trade at a sizable discount \nto developed markets and they also \ncarry a favorable earnings outlook. \nFurther, the Chinese government \nrecently introduced stimulus intended \nto boost demand and stabilize the real \nestate market. Investors initially reacted \nfavorably to these measures, although \nthey should consider the impact of \n\npotential U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods \nbased on campaign rhetoric from U.S. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump. We are \nskeptical that the stimulus will create  \na sustained cyclical turnaround or resolve \nChina’s structural issues, but we think it \nis a step in the right direction. \n\nAlthough emerging markets are about \nmuch more than China, the country \naccounts for 27% of the MSCI Emerging \nMarkets Index’s weighting. The Asia-\nPacific region including China accounts \nfor 80% of the index, so it is hard to  \nsee emerging markets thriving without \na tailwind from China.\n\nDespite the concentration to Asia-\nPacific, emerging markets continue  \nto offer exposures to a diverse set of \nthemes both global and local in nature. \nWith elevated market concentration in \ndeveloped markets, driven largely by \nthe U.S., diversification is especially \nimportant. Emerging market equities \ncan continue to play an important role \nin investor portfolios, especially given \nthe potential offered by favorable \nvaluations, earnings growth and \ndiversification benefits to developed \nmarket equities. With a valuation \ncushion, and other emerging markets \noutside of China with brighter outlooks, \nwe stay constructive on emerging \nmarkets in 2025.\n\nEXHIBIT 5\n\nThe Drag of Share Issuance\n\nTotal Return Breakdown (%) (October 2014–October 2024)\n\n■ Revenue     ■ Shares     ■ Valuations     ■ Dividend     l Total return\n\n10.6\n\n6.4\n\n2.6\n\n15.2\n\n10.6\n\n10.1\n\n5.6\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n-15\n\nGlobal \nmarkets\n\nEmerging \nmarkets\n\nChina\n\nTaiwan\n\nIndia\n\nSouth Korea\n\nBrazil\n\nSources: Northern Trust, FactSet, MSCI, Bloomberg.

In January, federal funds futures14 \nmarkets implied as many as six to seven \nquarter-point reductions by the end  \nof 2024 — an expectation we and  \nmany others viewed as an overreaction. \nMarkets dialed back rate cut expectations \nthroughout the remainder of the first \nand second quarter. The Fed ultimately \nheld policy rates steady for more than  \na year before delivering a half-point \n“recalibration” rate cut in September \nand a quarter-point cut in November.\n\nFor 2025, there is significant uncertainty \nover the economic outlook and \nmonetary policy. A fairly wide range  \nof outcomes with respect to the  \nfederal funds target range are possible. \nAccordingly, we favor a neutral position \nfor our portfolios. Importantly for \nmoney market investors, we and the \nmarkets see little chance rates return to \nthe zero lower bound anytime soon —  \na welcome change from much of the \npast 15 years of very low yields on cash. \n\nWhile the federal funds target range  \nis the biggest driver of money market \nfund yields, money markets also \n\nexhibited signs of normalization in \n2024, with more rate volatility within  \nthe federal funds target range. Credit \nspreads were generally little changed, \nto slightly tighter. While participation  \nin the Fed’s reverse repurchase \nagreement operations (RRP)15 peaked \nat $2.3 trillion in 2023, it has trended \nsubstantially lower to as low as $150 \nbillion. This is a consequence of \nbalance sheet reduction by the Fed. \nWhile money market rate volatility is \nnormal, rates near or above the top  \nof the target range may be a sign of \nreserve scarcity. The Fed’s balance \nsheet reduction may need to end, a \ndynamic we’ll be monitoring closely. \n\nWhile intuition may suggest that as \nyields on money market funds move \nlower along with policy rates they \nwould be less attractive and drive \noutflows, we’ve seen the opposite  \nin 2024, consistent with historical \nexperience. Money market fund \nindustry assets have increased by  \nmore than $500 billion this year (see \nexhibit), setting all-time-high records. \nAssets have been going up even as \nrates are going down, as money market \nfunds remain an attractive alternative \nto other cash management options  \nlike deposits or Treasury bills.\n\n14 Federal funds futures are contracts used to hedge short-term interest rate risk.

On the domestic front, German \ngrowth remains a key concern and \ncorporate profit margins have come \nunder pressure. This in turn is leading \nto companies’ unwillingness to absorb \nhigher wages and labor hoarding,16 \nwhich will place further downside \npressure on growth and the  \ninflation outlook. \n\nExternal growth factors are also \ncontributing to headwinds in European \ngrowth. Both China’s below-trend \ngrowth outlook and uncertainty over \npotential tariffs imposed by the U.S.  \nwill likely play an important role for \nEuropean growth. Given the soft growth \nand inflation outlook, we believe the \nEuropean Central Bank will continue to \nease monetary policy into 2025, reducing \nmoney market rates. This path is likely \nto continue to be one that is taken with \ncaution until they reach a neutral rate  \nof close to 2%. However, given the \ndownside risks highlighted, risks are \ntilted to a more aggressive pace of rate \ncuts to below our 2% neutral level. \n\nIn the U.K., more spending outlined  \nin the Labour government’s budget, \nalong with continued sticky inflation \nfrom both services and wages,  \n\nhas resulted in higher inflation \nexpectations by the Bank of England. \nThis supports the central bank’s \napproach of gradual rate cuts, giving  \nit time to monitor the budget's impact. \nThe pace of cuts will likely follow a \ngradual approach which we interpret \nto be no faster than a quarterly pace.  \nAs we look into 2025, the prospect  \nof higher inflation will likely linger, \npotentially forcing the Bank of England \nto pause rate cuts earlier than investors \nexpect. Although we are sympathetic \nto the market’s view, we still believe the \nbank will cut rates to 3.75%, with risks \ntilted to the upside.\n\nThe Bank of Japan remains a monetary \npolicy outlier as they continue to  \nexit decades of extreme monetary \npolicy easing. We believe that further \nmonetary policy tightening will be \nmeasured and moderate. The more \nrecent political turmoil in Japan has \nhighlighted the public’s dissatisfaction \nwith rising prices and the need for \nfurther fiscal easing in Japan. Given \nthose factors, as well as expectations of \nwage increases in the second quarter \nof 2025, we believe the Bank of Japan \nwill continue to increase its policy rate \nin a slow and measured manner, to \nclose to 0.75%.\n\n16 Labor hoarding often occurs in tight labor markets, when companies who need to cut \ncosts avoid laying off workers because they may be difficult or costly to hire later.\n\nEXHIBIT 7\n\nDivergent Policy Rate Paths\n\nEurozone, U.K. and Japan Historical and Forward Policy Rates\n\n U.K. official bank rate \n BoE forward rates      \n\n Euro area official bank rate \n ECB forward rates      \n\n Japan official bank rate \n BoJ forward rates\n\n5.5\n\n4.5\n\n3.5\n\n2.5\n\n1.5\n\n0.5\n\n)\n\n%\n\n(\n \ns\ne\nt\na\nr\n \ny\nc\n\ni\nl\n\n \n\no\np\nB\nC\nE\nd\nn\na\n\n \n\n \n.\n\n.\n\nK\nU\n\n-0.5\n\nBoJ, 0.7\n\nBoE, 4.0\n\nECB, 2.06\n\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n-0.1\n-0.2\n\nJ\na\np\na\nn\np\no\n\n \n\nl\ni\n\nc\ny\n \nr\na\nt\ne\n \n(\n\n%\n\n)\n\nOct \n2021\n\nApr \n2022\n\nOct \n2022\n\nApr \n2023\n\nOct \n2023\n\nApr \n2024\n\nOct \n2024\n\nApr \n2025\n\nOct \n2025\n\nApr \n2026\n\nOct \n2026\n\nSource: Bloomberg, data as of November 11, 2024.

In September, inflation fell to 2.4%, \nbased on the Consumer Price Index, the \nreference inflation index for Treasury \nInflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), and \n3.3% for core inflation, which excludes \nmore volatile food and gas prices.17 \n\nIn 2025, we anticipate that inflation will \nremain contained with a tendency to \ndrift slightly higher than the Federal \nReserve’s 2% target. Considering our \nexpectation that economic growth \nremains positive, albeit below the \ncurrent trend rate, we think there is little \nimpetus for inflation to bridge the final \ngap to the Fed’s target. In addition, \npersistently high government spending \ndeficits have spurred rising U.S. \ngovernment debt, which could \npotentially pressure inflation upwards. \nGlobal political tension in Ukraine  \nand the Middle East risk contributing  \nto inflation through commodity-price \nspikes as well as increased anti-\ncompetitive forces in China contributing \nto added tariffs. \n\nTen-year real interest rates are over 2% \nand breakeven rates, or the difference \nbetween similar-maturity nominal \nTreasury yields and TIPS yields, are \n\nhovering between 2.3% and 2.6% \ndepending on the time horizon (see \nexhibit for more information). This \nmeans the TIPS market is priced for \nnear perfection, reflecting expectations \nthat the Fed will successfully meet their \n2% inflation target over the next 10 \nyears. Given our expectations of slightly \nhigher inflation, TIPS will likely benefit \nfrom the inflation accruals outpacing \nbreakeven rates over the next year. \n\nThe exhibit shows the breakeven  \npriced into the TIPS market relative  \nto year-over year inflation. As noted \nearlier, in the last few years, inflation has \nbeen trending above breakeven rates, \nwhich benefits TIPS investors relative  \nto similar maturity Treasurys.\n\nWhile many asset classes that capture a \nmarket risk premium can help to buffer \na portfolio over time — for example \nequities and high yield bonds — TIPS \nare one of few asset classes that we \nexpect to perform well in a defensive \nenvironment with a direct link to \ninflation. While we have our expectations \nof inflation settling into a range above \n2% for 2025, we expect the path to  \nbe bumpy. So we believe TIPS are  \nan important defensive portfolio \ncomponent for unanticipated inflation.\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n2004\n\nEXHIBIT 8\n\nInflation Trending Above Breakeven Rates\n\nInflation vs. Breakeven Rates (%)\n Year-over-year inflation (CPI)     \n 10-year breakeven rate\n\n 5-year breakeven rate \n\n2006\n\n2008\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\n2014\n\n2016\n\n2016\n\n2018\n\n2020\n\n2022\n\nSource: Bloomberg.

Over \nthe last four years, sectors within the \ninvestment grade credit market that  \nare more sensitive to the economic \ncycle have significantly improved their \nbalance sheet strength. \n\nAlthough the proportion of lower-rated \ncompanies in the market is above  \nthe long-term historical average, this \nratings mix fell to 47% in July 2024  \nfrom 52% in January 2019.19 Moreover, \nthe proportion of the lower-rated \ncompanies approaching high \nyield ratings (BBB-) has improved \nsignificantly and sits at its lowest level  \nin 10 years. This should constrain \nspreads at the wider end of the  \nrange in the event of any unexpected \nweakness in economic growth.\n\nThe technical backdrop for investment \ngrade bonds remains strong with \nhigher yields attracting interest from \ninsurance companies, pension funds \nand non-U.S. buyers (see investment \nflows in exhibit). Supply is projected to \nbe $1.4 trillion for 2024 and is expected \nto increase modestly in 2025, with \nrefinancing driving the rise. Mergers \nand acquisitions could drive supply \nhigher than expected, but the deals \ncurrently in the pipeline are modest. \n\nWe believe security selection and \nsector allocation will be key as we \nexpect spreads generally to remain \ndormant. The banking and related \nsectors that were attractive in 2024 \nhave largely performed well as \nexpected, and we are turning our \nattention to other themes. Some \nexamples include companies that \nbenefit from artificial intelligence  \nand related services. \n\nFor those companies that have suffered \nfrom weak manufacturing demand,  \nwe expect potential bottoming and \nopportunities to re-enter in 2025. In  \nthe healthcare sector, profitability was \nhurt in managed care by medical costs \nover the last few quarters. However,  \nwe expect this pressure moving on to  \nthe healthcare providers and medical \nequipment companies going forward, \nas insurance companies try to restore \ntheir margins. \n\nOverall, we believe 2025 will be an \nenvironment where investors will seek \nyield, and they are likely to quickly  \npick up any weakness in spreads. Risks \nto our outlook are an unexpected \ndeterioration in economic growth and/\nor a resurgence of inflation, which puts \na restrictive monetary policy stance \nback on the table.\n\n18 The credit spread often is the difference between yield of a corporate bond and a  \ngovernment bond, such as a Treasury, of similar maturity.

Leverage continues  \nto sit below historical averages while \ninterest coverage ratios20 remain above \naverage. As a result, credit ratings \nupgrades are outpacing downgrades. \nThe net result is the composition of the \nhigh yield market remains close to the \nhighest quality since inception.\n\nLooking ahead, we expect companies \nto maintain better-than-average \nbalance sheets given funding costs  \nare higher than the decade before the \npandemic. Recent economic drivers \nsuch as the artificial intelligence boom \nhave dramatically impacted some  \nof the previously distressed segments \nin the market. As a result of these \nfundamental drivers, the percentage  \nof distressed companies continues  \nto decline, which bodes well for \nmaintaining future low default rates. \nCombined with strong balance sheets, \ndefault rates are likely to remain well \nbelow the 4% historical average. \n\nThe technical picture in high yield \nremains supportive. After two years  \nof contraction in 2022 and 2023, the \nhigh yield market is on track to expand \n\nslightly in 2024. Issuance picked up  \nthis year as financing costs normalized \nand are close to current yields. However, \nnet issuance remained low as companies \nmaintain a conservative stance and focus \non refinancing rather than re-leveraging.\n\nOn the demand side, inflows for  \nthe asset class have been strong as \ninvestors look to lock in attractive \nyields. Against a backdrop of expected \ncontinued monetary policy easing, we \nbelieve the trend of refinancing activity \nwill remain a primary driver of issuance. \nThe decline in interest rates and a  \nmore constructive macro outlook could  \ndrive a potential pickup in merger and \nacquisition activity, which could lead  \nto a slight uptick in net issuance.\n\nValuation remains favorable in the high \nyield market. The starting yield21 of 7.29% \n(as of November 15, 2024) is among the \nhighest since the Global Financial Crisis \nperiod (2007–2008) and supports \nattractive returns.

In addition to \nexperiencing higher volatility, the \nmortgage market underwent structural \nchanges of its composition and \nownership. This “reset” the fair value  \nof spreads for mortgages above their \nlong-run historical levels for some  \ntime (see exhibit), in the end offering \nattractive valuations both outright  \nand relative to other sectors. \n\nWhen in September the Fed initiated  \na highly anticipated rate-cutting cycle, \nwe correctly predicted that implied \nvolatility would decline, which in turn \nwould have positioned valuations of \nmortgage-backed securities well for \n2025. Prior to that point, uncertainty \nabout the size of the first rate cut and \nthe subsequent pace of monetary \npolicy easing helped keep volatility \nelevated by historical standards. Since \nthen, however, uncertainty in the wake \nof the U.S. elections has made the path \nof interest rates less clear and we view \nthe effect of volatility on valuations to \nbe net neutral.\n\nStill, U.S. mortgage-backed spreads \ncontinue to offer value in our view.  \nFrom a technical perspective, we expect \nsupply in 2025 (including Fed sales from \nits balance sheet) to be about the same \nas the $400 billion in expected issuance \nthis year. This remains far below the \n\nrecord refinance years of 2020 to 2022, \nwhich resulted in $500 billion to $800 \nbillion in net issuance per year. The drop \nin supply could keep the market tight, \nbenefiting prices.\n\nFurther, prepayment risk, most \nprominent when borrowers pay off \ntheir mortgages early to refinance, \nremains very low with close to 95% \nof outstanding mortgages carrying \ninterest rates below current market \nrates. This results in better “convexity” \nfor investors relative to history, where \ninvestors tend to gain more when \ninterest rates fall by a certain amount \nthan they would lose when interest \nrates rise by the same amount. \n\nThese factors, combined with attractive \nvaluations and an expectation that in \nthe longer term volatility could decline \nfurther from current still elevated levels, \ncould benefit mortgage securities in \nseveral ways. First, we expect banks — \nthe largest single mortgage investor \ngroup which historically owned 25% \nto 30% of outstanding mortgage-\nbacked securities — to return to adding \nmortgages again after a year and a  \nhalf of reductions. This could increase \ndemand for mortgage-backed \nsecurities. Second, we expect the \nspreads in mortgage sector to tighten, \nimproving returns. Third, we believe \nlower volatility will drive up the  \nrisk-adjusted returns,22 making the  \naddition of mortgages more attractive \nfor inclusion in multi-sector fixed \nincome portfolios.\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n)\n\n%\n\n(\n \ne\nt\na\nr\n \nt\ne\ng\nr\na\nt\n \ns\nd\nn\nu\nf\n \n\nd\ne\nF\n\n0\n2004\n\nEXHIBIT 11\n\nPotential Benefits from Fed’s New Rate Path\n\nMortgage-Backed Security Spreads vs. Fed Rate and Bond Volatility\n\n Fed funds target rate (%, left axis)      \n Bond volatility (MOVE index, Index price, right axis)      \n Current coupon MBS spread (basis points, right axis)\n\n300\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\nS\np\nr\ne\na\nd\n\n \ni\n\n \n\n \n\ni\n\nn\nb\na\ns\ni\ns\np\no\nn\nt\ns\nM\nO\nV\nE\np\nr\ni\nc\ne\n\n,\n \n\n \n\n2006\n\n2008\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\n2014\n\n2016\n\n2018\n\n2020\n\n2022\n\n2024\n\nSource: Bloomberg.

The current broad municipal \nindex yield of 3.59% (as of November \n15, 2024) provides significant cushion \nfor total return and we think the taxable \nequivalent yield24 of more than 6% will \ncontinue to attract investor demand. \nWe expect this healthy demand for \nmunicipals to offset pressure from likely \npositive net issuance in 2025. Credit \nspreads are tight, yet we see no major \ncatalyst to drive spreads wider.\n\nWe believe fundamental municipal \ncredit is strong, and state and local \ngovernment resiliency to economic \nadversity is high. Healthy reserves, \nimproved pension funding and less \ndebt provides a margin of safety  \nfrom unexpected policy, economic  \nor other shock events. We maintain  \na constructive bias on not-for-profit \nhealthcare sector fundamentals based \non improving credit trends.

Given the election results,  \nwe expect the federal government to \nextend much of the tax cuts from 2017, \nmost of which are set to expire in 2025. \nThis would make tax increases — which \nwould increase municipal relative value \n— unlikely. We also expect a debate \naround changes to the municipal  \nbond tax exemption, yet we think an \nelimination of the exemption is unlikely. \nThe rapid growth in Treasury supply, \ndriven by large federal deficits, as \ncompared to the slower growing \nmunicipal supply, should protect \nmunicipal relative value from a major \ncorrection and keep ratios rangebound.\n\n23 The yield of a bond or bond index at the beginning of a period, often to be compared to  \na yield at the end of a period. 24 Because income from municipal bonds is exempt from U.S. \nincome taxes, they usually have lower yields than similar-maturity taxable fixed income invest-\nments such as corporate bonds.

With \nalmost $2 trillion of commercial real \nestate loans scheduled to mature over \nthe next three years (per the Mortgage \nBankers Association), headline risk  \nfor the commercial market could lead \nto some investor caution. U.S. office \nmarkets continue to contend with high \nvacancy levels, and regional banks — \nthe most significant capital provider  \nto commercial real estate — face \nincreasing pressure to shrink their \nexposure. However, this is creating \nopportunities for alternative lenders. \n\nWe also expect further normalization in \ninvestment volumes and asset pricing, \nsupported by falling borrowing costs. \nThere is only slight exposure (about \n5%) to the office sector across publicly \ntraded global real estate investment \ntrusts (REITs). We believe other more \nsizeable areas of the market are \npositioned for structural growth. This \nincludes data centers (demand related \nto artificial intelligence), industrial \n(e-commerce), healthcare (demo-\ngraphics) and residential (shortage  \nof housing) real estate. \n\nGlobal listed infrastructure also \nperformed well in 2024. In 2025, we \nexpect infrastructure to continue to \nserve as a useful tool for diversification, \ninflation mitigation and income \n\ngeneration. Many areas of the asset \nclass should benefit from surging  \nforecasts for global power demand \nand the investment needed by utilities \nto service this growth. The increasing \nelectricity needs to power artificial \nintelligence presents a growth \nopportunity for the global utility  \nsector, which as a regulated industry \nhas historically experienced only \nmoderate growth.\n\nWith the retirement of coal plants, \ninvestment into natural gas, nuclear \nand renewable energy has increased \nand earnings growth has roughly \ndoubled.26 Further, given its bond-like \nprofile, global listed infrastructure \nshould benefit if we experience a decline \nin interest rates. Over the longer term, a \ntransition into sustainable infrastructure \nsolutions should provide support for \nstructural growth. \n\nGlobal natural resources under-\nperformed real estate and infra-\nstructure in 2024. Oil production \nrestraint remains a tailwind for the \nasset class, which we favor as a hedge \nagainst geopolitical risk. Continued \nstrong fundamentals (persistent cash \nflows, tight commodity markets, \nstronger balance sheets and lower \ncapital expenditures) should support \nnatural resources as an important \nhedge against higher inflation and \ngeopolitical escalations.

Less expected \n\nregulation from the incoming U.S. \nadministration may encourage more \nmerger and acquisition activity, new \nissues and initial public offerings.  \nWhile deal spreads32 may be tighter, \nthe increased activity should be a good \nenvironment for event strategies. \n\nMacro: Macro funds invest in equities, \nfixed income, currencies and \ncommodities based on economic \nvariables and capital flows. Macro relies \non dispersion between countries for  \nits opportunity set, whether that is \ndifferences in interest rate regimes, \neconomic growth, fiscal policy or other \nfactors. A world with increased tariffs, \ntrade disputes and differing interest \nrate policy likely present ample \nopportunities for macro investors. \n\nRelative value: Relative value \nmanagers invest where they believe \nthere is a valuation discrepancy in  \nthe relationship between multiple \nsecurities. Typically they are long one \nsecurity and short another security, \nexpecting the relative valuations of  \nthe two to either converge or diverge. \nRelative value funds typically have  \na low correlation to overall market \ndirection but instead tend to perform \nin environments with more volatility \nand dispersion.

With another \nrate cut in November and more \npotentially coming, we expect lower \nbase rates will accelerate merger and \nacquisition (M&A) activity, especially for \nprivate equity sponsors that continue \nto sit on record levels of dry powder \n(capital that has been raised but not  \nyet deployed). \n\nAlthough we also expect lower rates  \nto compress yields to some extent,  \nwe believe private credit33 deployment  \nwill increase in conjunction with the \nexpected pickup in M&A activity.  \nPrivate credit continues to serve as  \nthe preferred source of financing for \nprivate equity sponsors given increased \nflexibility and certainty of execution. \nSpecifically, direct lenders are likely to \ncontinue to capture market share in the \nlower middle market as traditional bank \nlenders’ appetite for smaller businesses \ncontinues to decline. \n\nThere has been some concern about \nthe growth of the private credit market \nover the last few years. Private credit is \n\nnow the second largest private capital \nasset class behind private equity, with \n$1.6 trillion of private debt assets \nunder management compared to  \n$8.5 trillion for private equity.34 However, \nwe believe that the growth of private \ncredit is well supported by the secular \nshift of lending from traditional capital \nproviders to private credit asset \nmanagers, as well as the size of the \nprivate equity market and private \nbusiness sector. Specifically, private \nequity dry powder levels continue to \nfar exceed the current supply of private \ncredit dry powder (see exhibit).\n\nAdditionally, direct lending by nature  \nis typically less exposed to cyclical \nindustries, mitigating the risk for \nunderperformance in down cycles. \nFurthermore, most direct lending \ntransactions have strong downside \nprotection through seniority in the \ncapital structure, financial covenants, \ninterest rate floors and active portfolio \nmanagement. These characteristics \nhave proven attractive to investors, \ndriving interest in the asset class and \nincreased flow of capital, specifically \nwith strategies that focus on first lien \nsenior secured debt.35\n\n33 Private credit or private debt investments are debt-like, non-publicly traded instruments  \nprovided by non-bank entities, such as private credit funds, to fund private businesses. 34 First \nAvenue Partners LLP and Preqin as of December 31, 2023. 35 First lien senior secured debt has \nfirst rights on collateral and cash payouts in case a company enters bankruptcy, making it a safer \ninvestment than lower tier debt.\n\ns\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nb\n$\n\n \n\n1,200\n\n1,000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\nEXHIBIT 15\n\nPrivate Equity Dry Powder Well Exceeds Private Debt\n\nDry Powder: Private Equity vs. Private Credit\n\n■ Private equity     ■ Private credit\n\n20 0 0\n\n20 01\n\n20 02\n\n20 03\n\n20 04\n\n20 05\n\n20 06\n\n20 07\n\n20 08\n\n20 09\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\nFiscal years ended (November for 2024)\n\nSource: Pitchbook.

In \nthe more benign risk scenario, stronger \ngrowth accompanies inflation. We \nbelieve this would result in equities \noutperforming fixed income. Equities \nhistorically have been able to maintain \ntoday’s valuations with inflation at  \nor even above 4%, but growth is \nimportant. In the second risk scenario, \nthere is no positive growth impulse. \n\nWe would expect higher inflation to \nweigh on equities and most other \nmajor assets, with few other assets such \nas gold ending up as beneficiaries. \n\n“Buy America” is another one of our key \ntactical calls. We expect U.S. equities  \nto benefit from a better economic \nbackdrop and healthier corporate \nprofits than most other regions. We \nalso believe that non-U.S. companies \nare more negatively exposed to the \npolicies floated by the incoming U.S. \ngovernment. For example, higher \ntariffs likely would weigh on Chinese \nand European company profits, while \nnon-U.S. regions would see little \nbenefit from U.S. tax cuts and reduced \nregulation. With that said, there is a \nwide range of potential outcomes, \nsupporting regional diversification  \nin a portfolio.\n\nWithin fixed income, we continue  \nto like high yield. Its starting yield of \nabove 7%41 is attractive given strong \nfundamentals and a supportive \ntechnical backdrop. We see more \nlimited upside for investment grade \ncredit and Treasurys given historically \ntight investment grade spreads and \nlow odds of a sharp drop in rates.  \nGiven we do see incrementally higher \ninflation risks as a result of possible \npolicies from the U.S. government, we \nthink some inflation protection through \ninflation-linked bonds is prudent.\n\n3.8\n\n3.6\n\n3.4\n\n3.2\n\n3.0\n\n2.8\n\n2.6\n\n2.4\n8/31/2024\n\nEXHIBIT 17\n\nHigher Expectations\n\nExpected Minimum Fed Policy Rate Through 2026 (%)\n\n9/15/2024\n\n9/30/2024\n\n10/15/2024\n\n10/30/2024\n\n11/14/2024\n\nSources: Northern Trust Asset Management, Bloomberg.

Cronk\n\nDecember 2019\n\n2019 was largely characterized by a tug-of-war between substantial geopolitical drags and offsetting \nglobal monetary policy easing. The third slowdown of this expansion took hold at midyear, once again \ncreating concerns about the timing and cause of the next recession. Ironically, all equity asset classes, \nand even several fixed income asset classes, have delivered double-digit returns, despite these concerns.\n\nThese geopolitical drags have weighed heavily on business sentiment, producing a sharp deceleration \nin global capital spending and manufacturing output. However, this slowdown has remained largely \ncontained as labor market strength and ever-lower borrowing rates have supported consumer \nspending and service-sector activity. \n\nFor now, we remain comfortable that the expansion can again weather this storm as the calendar turns into 2020, even \nwhile traditional late-cycle signals abound. A surge of global liquidity has kept U.S. rates near cycle lows and created a flood \nof negative-yielding international debt. These warnings and the 2019 inversion of the U.S. yield curve suggest that monetary \npolicy stimulus struggled to keep pace as growth slowed. We believe the rising dispersion in credit spreads and anemic global \nearnings growth are also reliable signals of a mature expansion. \n\nFor the global economy to stay resilient, we anticipate three ""C""s will be necessary: Consumer spending needs to remain \nsolid; fixed-income credit spreads need to remain well behaved; and the China-U.S. trade dispute needs to de-escalate. The \nU.S.-China trade conflict will likely remain the greatest among the domestic and geopolitical wild cards this year. Investors \nappear willing to embrace risk as long as trade war rhetoric is stable or improving, even if real trade progress remains elusive. \nNot surprisingly, we expect elevated 2020 election rhetoric and have low expectations for major fiscal or legislative policy \nchanges. Fortunately, a look at history shows that presidential election years have generally produced positive equity results. \nSince 1928, only 4 of the 23 presidential election years have experienced negative S&P 500 Index returns. Three of those \nfour occurred during recession years. Elections matter, but the economy may predict them better than opinion polls do.\n\nAs investors, we cannot always accurately predict geopolitical outcomes or the exact dates when expansions end, but we \ncan remain diligent and resilient. Investors can instill this resilience in their portfolios during this late part of the economic \ncycle by wisely positioning exposure to risk assets. Strong 2019 performance across equities, fixed income, and real assets \naffords investors a unique and timely opportunity to ensure that positioning and exposure reflect the right risk/reward \nopportunity for late-cycle investing. The sage advice of Warren Buffett rings true when he said, ""Predicting rain doesn\'t \ncount; building arks does."" It is best to build the portfolio ark before it begins raining.  I trust our 2020 Outlook will help you \ndo just that. \n\nOn behalf of my Wells Fargo Investment Institute \ncolleagues, I want to thank you for the trust you extend to \nus and wish you investment success in 2020.     \n\n“ Predicting rain doesn’t count; \nbuilding arks does.”  \n\n—Warren Buffett\n\nDarrell L.

Two of those trends involve \nChina. First, China continues to prioritize services growth over construction and \nmanufacturing. Second, the U.S.-China trade dispute likely will weigh on \nmanufacturing and commodity consumption. These two trends have global \nimplications, especially for Europe and Asia, where machinery and commodity \nexports are a relatively large part of local economies. Economic growth is \nexpected to downshift in the U.S., Europe, and much of Asia.1\n\nAs a third trend, employment growth in services should remain a steady and \npositive economic growth driver across Asia, Europe, and the U.S. In turn, more \njobs and rising wages should continue to support stable consumer spending. We \nanticipate ongoing U.S. job expansion, albeit at a slower rate than in 2019. Rising \naverage U.S. wages should continue attracting workers back into the labor force. \nAs job seekers return, the U.S. unemployment rate should remain near multi-\ndecade lows. \n\nWe believe subdued business spending growth and steady-to-lower commodity \nprices should contain global inflation near central bank target rates in the U.S., \nEurope, and Japan. Low inflation, slow economic growth, and political \nuncertainties may compel further interest rate cuts. But to what effect? \n\nOur fourth expected trend addresses that question, as falling interest rates may \nnot stimulate faster personal spending growth while the geopolitical risks loom \nlarge. Until the 2008 financial crisis, falling interest rates led to lower savings \nrates (see chart on page 5). After the financial crisis, interest rates fell further, but \ncautious households increased their saving. \n\nThese four trends underpin our forecasts for slowing economic growth and  \nlow inflation for the U.S. and the largest international economies. Our overall \nforecast for world economic growth is marginally below our 2019 estimate, \nalthough a few emerging economies (for example, Brazil, Mexico, and South \nAfrica) are reaccelerating after weak periods. When we consider the world\'s \nlargest markets, the dichotomy between solid consumer spending and  \nslowing business spending implies that the global economy is still not firing  \non all cylinders. \n\n1.

The savings rate is the monthly \nU.S. personal savings as a percent of personal income after taxes. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield is a monthly average of daily \nrates, in percent. \n\nRisks to continued economic growth \n\nWe do not anticipate a U.S. economic recession, but the signs of an aging cycle \nare increasing (see sidebar). The likelihood of a U.S. recession depends upon \nwhether (or how quickly) weak manufacturing cracks the economic expansion\'s \nfoundation in job and wage growth and associated consumer confidence. The \nwide range of possible risks to our economic outlook may fuel more financial \nmarket volatility. Global growth remains slow enough that geopolitical \ndisruptions could undercut consumer confidence. The main upside risk comes \nfrom potential policy stimulus. If geopolitical shocks subside, interest rate cuts \neventually could give the global economy some traction. De-escalation of trade \ntensions or globally coordinated fiscal stimulus (either tax cuts or spending) \nwould be positive but seem unlikely. We believe that Europe and the U.S. will be \nunable to deliver much fiscal stimulus. China could open the spending spigots on \ninfrastructure projects, as it did in 2016, but its leaders seem unwilling to add \nsignificant new debt. \n\nPlease see pages 22 to 24 for important notes, definitions, and risk considerations.\n\n2020 Outlook |  5\n\n\x0cKey takeaways:\n\n•  Wells Fargo Securities Economics \n\nGroup forecasts slowing \neconomic growth and low \ninflation for the U.S. and the \nlargest international economies. \nGlobal growth may show little \nimprovement in 2020. \n\n•  The U.S. dollar could depreciate \n\nmoderately versus other \nemerging market and developed \nmarket currencies.\n\nWhat it means for investors:\n\n•  The main risks are political  \nand binary: trade-dispute \nescalation could incite recession, \nor receding trade disputes  \ncould make monetary stimulus \nmore effective. \n\n•  The risk of a sharp move in  \nthe U.S. dollar or in global \neconomic growth remains \nuncommonly elevated. \n\nWe expect that the U.S. dollar\'s supports will continue \nbut may weaken in 2020. \n\nThe major international currencies have traded in wide ranges against the U.S. \ndollar since 2015, but we believe the U.S. dollar is nearing a cyclical peak. We \nexpect a growing supply of dollars to dominate the yield-seeking demand \nglobally and to lead the dollar moderately lower.\n\nThe risks to this weaker dollar outlook include lower-probability possibilities for \na larger move lower or even a new dollar rally. Broadening U.S. trade disputes or \ndeepening domestic political divisions could damage the U.S. economy or \nencourage deeper Fed rate cuts and dollar depreciation. Global central bank \naction also is key. Should the Fed pause, while the European Central Bank (ECB) \nand Bank of Japan (BOJ) push rates to ever-more-negative levels, dollar strength \ncould persist.\n\nWe foresee mixed trends for emerging market currencies. The environment is \nstill challenging for the currencies of Pacific Rim economies, which have \nelevated political risks and are exposed to trade disputes. By contrast, we believe \nthe economies now recovering after recessions, those making fiscal reforms, and \nthose that have scope for positive political and institutional surprises (for \nexample, Russia and Brazil) have the best chance to appreciate against the dollar.  \n\nMarket expectations imply that the policy rate differential will narrow in 2020\n\nIf central bank policy rate differentials narrow in 2020, that would support our view that \nthe dollar is nearing peak valuation relative to developed currencies.  \n\n2.5%\n\n2.0%\n\n1.5%\n\n1.0%\n\n0.5%\n\n0.0%\n\n-0.5%\n\n-1.0%\n\n\'12\n\n\'13\n\n\'14\n\n\'15\n\n\'16\n\n\'17\n\n\'18\n\n\'19\n\n\'20\n\n\'21\n\n\'22\n\n\'23\n\n\'24\n\n\'25\n\nFederal funds target (mid-rate)\n\nBOE official bank rate\n\nJPY-OIS implied overnight rate\n\nECB deposit rate\n\nUSD-OIS-implied overnight rate\n\nGPB-OIS-implied overnight rate\n\nBOJ policy balance rate \n\nEONIA-implied ECB deposit rate\n\nSources: Bloomberg and Wells Fargo Investment Institute, November 1, 2019.

For U.S. large-cap and \nmid-cap equities, we predict modest 5.9% and 3.0% earnings-per-share (EPS) \ngrowth rates, respectively. U.S. small caps may deliver 2020 earnings growth \nonly slightly higher than that of large caps (6.3% versus 5.9%), not a premium \nthat we believe compensates for their late-cycle risk.\n\nThe aging economic expansion clouds business decision making and leads to \nreduced business confidence and slower capital expenditures. Yet, three 2019 \nFed interest rate cuts provide a late-cycle tailwind that, on balance, we believe \nwill support slightly higher equity valuations in 2020, except in U.S. small-cap \nequities. We are projecting valuations—as measured by forward price/earnings \n(P/E)—at 18.3 times earnings for U.S. large caps and 17.9 times for mid caps. We \nforesee a small increase for our 2020 mid-cap valuation because mid caps show \nhigher exposure than large caps to smaller manufacturers that often comprise \nglobal supply chains.\n\nSmall-cap equities should decline slightly. We project a P/E ratio of 23.3 times \nearnings, below the 2019 average, because we think some small-cap companies \nmay have less ability to access capital and could face profit growth challenges as \nthe U.S. economy slows. To prepare equity portfolios for 2020, we again favor \nthe risk/reward balance in U.S. large- and mid-cap equities over small-cap \nequities. \n\nWe also favor high-quality equity classes and sectors \nover those of lower quality. \n\nWe favor equity sectors that have comparatively strong earnings and cash flows \nand attractive cash/debt positions. These quality and growth characteristics \nshould help these sectors resist the worst of the market volatility we expect \namid the uncertainty about the maturing economic cycle and geopolitical \nuncertainties. Thus, our favored sectors include Information Technology and \nConsumer Discretionary, based on their high quality and projected growth \ncharacteristics. We also favor the Financials sector, due to discounted  \nvaluations and the opportunity for yield. We have an unfavorable view on  \nthe Communication Services and Materials sectors, which exhibit low  \nquality characteristics.\n\nPlease see pages 22 to 24 for important notes, definitions, and risk considerations.\n\n2020 Outlook |  7\n\n\x0cFavored international regions\n\n•  Developed Markets ex-U.S./\n\nPacific Region\n\n•  Emerging Markets/Europe, \n\nMiddle East, and Africa Region\n\nIn international markets, we expect a wave of EPS \ndowngrades and modest valuations\n\nAs we pointed out on page 4, China\'s programmed slowdown and the U.S.-China \ntrade dispute are important trends that could affect manufacturing in 2020. \nThese trends help explain a pattern of international EPS growth differences  \nthat we believe will continue. The chart below shows a snapshot of the trend. \nCountries where household spending on services is increasing rapidly (for \nexample, Brazil, Italy, and China) have posted strong earnings growth, even  \nwhile many countries that are major suppliers of industrial and technology \ngoods struggled with earnings contraction (for example, Japan, Germany, and \nSouth Korea). \n\nPolicy and politics drive the widening international EPS divergence\n\nCountries with strong services growth outperformed global suppliers of industrial \nproducts, while global suppliers, underperformance widened.\n\n31.4\n\n)\n\n%\n\n \n\n(\n \nh\nt\nw\no\nr\ng\ns\ng\nn\nn\nr\na\ne\n9\n1\n0\n2\n\ni\n\n \n\n30.0\n\n20.0\n\n10.0\n\n0.0\n\n-10.0\n\n-20.0\n\n-30.0\n\n-40.0\n\n-50.0\n\n16.7 16.7\n\n11.3\n\n11.1\n\n8.9\n\n7.7\n\n4.4\n\n2.3\n\n1.1\n\n-.04 -1.1\n\n-1.4\n\n-8.2\n\n-13.2\n\n-15.6\n\n-26.7\n\n-28.9 -30.5\n\n-44.4\n\nBrazil\n\nItaly\n\nChina\nAustralia\n\nIndonesia\n\nRussia\nSwitzerland\n\nNetherlands\n\nCanada\n\nIndia\n\nUnited States\nUnited Kingdom\n\nSpain\n\nMexico\n\nFrance\n\nSaudi Arabia\nJapan\n\nGermany\n\nSouth Korea\nTurkey\n\nSources: Wells Fargo Investment Institute and FactSet, as of November 4, 2019. Note: EPS for each country uses the MSCI All \nCountry World Index (MSCI ACWI), except for the U.S., which uses the S&P 500 Index for EPS metrics.\n\nWe are neutral on most international regional guidance as we expect price \nreturns in the low-to-mid single digits globally. However, despite poor profit \ngrowth in developed Asian equities (chart), attractive valuations and better-\nthan-expected macro surprises have fueled a year-end market rally. And, 2020 \nmay see a fiscal stimulus package in Japan for the first time since 2016. This \nMSCI Japan rally has momentum in our view as multiple valuation metrics \nsupport long-term opportunity.\n\n8  |  2020 Outlook \n\nPlease see pages 22 to 24 for important notes, definitions, and risk considerations.\n\n\x0cA muted outlook for emerging market equities \n\nKey takeaways\n\nThe divergences in international EPS growth rates may create headwinds for \nemerging market equities heading into 2020. We project an overall modest \nincrease in emerging market earnings (+4.8%), reflecting strong domestic growth \nmuted by ongoing difficulties for companies sensitive to global manufacturing \nweakness. Meanwhile, emerging market equities are undervalued relative to U.S. \nequities, and we do not expect that this asset class will reflate. Using a forward \nP/E ratio of 12.4 times, which is consistent with the relatively depressed P/E \nratio late in 2019, we retain a neutral rating consistent with a mid-single-digit \nprice return for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index in 2020.\n\nDeveloped market equities will be constrained by the \nslowdown in global trade \n\nDeveloped markets currently show some attractive features, especially for \ninvestors looking for yield, but the previously discussed global divergence in \nearnings growth is likely to limit total returns to low single digits, consistent \nwith a neutral rating. Germany, the U.K., and Hong Kong generated only 21.8%, \n22.3%, and 45.0% of their revenue from domestic business, respectively. (The \nU.S. is comparatively more domestically oriented, with domestic revenue of \n61.8%). We believe these vulnerabilities should drive a contraction of 3% in \nannual EPS for the MSCI EAFE Index. We expect low global yields to attract \nyield-oriented investors to the 3.5% dividend yield of the MSCI EAFE Index, a \nyield above many global bonds. We look for dividend yield to support a small \nP/E multiple expansion to 15.0 times earnings. \n\n•  Our low-return outlook for U.S. \n\nequity markets indicates that the \n10-year U.S. bull market is likely to \nremain intact but slow in 2020. \n\n•  We are neutral on U.S.  \n\nand international equity classes, \naside from our unfavorable view \non U.S. small-cap equities.  \n\n• \n\nIf geopolitical tensions ease, the \nvaluations on international equity \nmarkets may rise and improve \ntheir outlook. \n\nWhat it means for investors\n\n•  We see opportunities for \n\nattractive yields and modest  \nprice returns in most equity  \nasset classes, and we favor \nopportunities to add quality and \ngrowth in our favored U.S. sectors.\n\nFavored asset class\n\n•  High-quality U.S. Large  \n\nCap Equities \n\nFavored equity sectors\n\n• \n\nInformation Technology\n\n•  Consumer Discretionary \n\n•  Financials\n\nPlease see pages 22 to 24 for important notes, definitions, and risk considerations.\n\n2020 Outlook |  9\n\n\x0cGlobal fixed income\n\nFinding opportunities amid  \nhistorically low yields\n\nOpportunities as the Fed ends its rate cuts\n\nSlower, but still positive, growth should allow the Fed to take a patient approach \nto monetary policy in 2020. The Fed has been carefully cutting rates as part of \nits ""mid-cycle adjustment."" We expect this current phase of Fed rate policy \nadjustment to end in 2020. While we expect a less active Fed in 2020, we \nremain convinced that rates across the yield curve will remain near historically \nlow levels. Our 10-year and 30-year Treasury yield target ranges (1.25% to 1.75% \nand 1.75% to 2.25%, respectively) for year-end 2020 suggest modestly lower \nrates in longer maturities. Still, we anticipate a relatively flat Treasury yield \ncurve in 2020.2 The projected yield curve shape suggests that market risks \nremain elevated; we favor short-term and intermediate-term fixed income.\n\n2. The Treasury yield curve was volatile in 2019—inverting for several months (with short-term interest rates above  \n\nlong-term rates).\n\nThe Treasury yield curve shape in late 2019 signaled potential issues ahead\n\nIn mid-2019, intermediate-term Treasury rates were lower than short-term Treasury \nrates, suggesting that investors foresaw higher future risk. \n\nBrian Rehling, CFA\nCo-Head of Global Fixed  \nIncome Strategy\n\nGeorge Rusnak, CFA\nCo-Head of Global Fixed  \nIncome Strategy \n\nLuis Alvarado\nInvestment Strategy Analyst\n\n)\n\n%\n\nl\n\n(\n \nd\ne\nY\n\ni\n\n3.5\n\n3.0\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nYears to maturity\n\nU.S. Treasury yield curve: October 31, 2018\n\nU.S. Treasury yield curve: October 31, 2019\n\nSources: Bloomberg and Wells Fargo Investment Institute, as of November 1, 2019.

Globally, the amount of negative-\nyielding debt outstanding3 increased over the past two years. Close to 70% of \nthat negative-yielding debt has been from government bonds issued by Japan, \nFrance, and Germany. We remain unfavorable on developed market fixed \nincome. The ECB and BOJ are likely to implement additional monetary easing \nmeasures. We currently favor a neutral stance on emerging market debt. We are \nconcerned that this fixed-income class will struggle at times in 2020 as \nvaluations and geopolitical uncertainty potentially increase risks.\n\nLow yields complicate the search for income\n\nThe exceptionally low-yield environment may be leading some investors to  \ntake increased risks in the search for yield opportunities. We believe that it  \nis important for investors to fully understand the risks associated with \ninvestments in lower-rated fixed-income securities. We remain unfavorable  \non the high-yield debt class, while current valuations are near historically \nexpensive levels. \n\nWe acknowledge that a more defensive credit posture can challenge income-\noriented investors, but we favor other ways to prepare portfolios for the year \nahead. Instead of high-yield debt, we favor higher credit quality and, more \ngenerally, a diversified income approach across asset classes. In addition to \ninvestment-grade credit, we also continue to favor preferred securities, which \nwere among the best fixed-income performers in 2019. While it is unlikely that \nthis performance will persist (given what we view as full valuations in this \nsector), we do view the preferred security sector as attractive for investors \nfocused on income generation. \n\nMunicipal bonds attractive for high-income investors\n\nFor investors in higher effective tax brackets, we believe municipal securities \nremain an important part of fixed-income positioning. We expect municipal \ndemand to remain strong in high-tax states. Yet, with limited supply and \nvaluation increases fueled by strong demand, investors must be selective in their \npurchases. In-state bonds have become a higher priority for buyers in high-tax \nstates, including California and New York, as the federal deduction for state \nincome taxes has been capped. Several leading Democratic presidential \ncandidates have proposed either rolling back the recently passed tax cuts or \nimplementing new taxes (such as a wealth tax). If taxes were to rise, this could \nmake municipal bonds\' tax benefits even more attractive.\n\n3. The U.S. dollar value of this debt ranged between $10 trillion and $17 trillion for most of 2019.\n\nKey takeaways\n\n•  We expect the Fed to take a  \nmore wait-and-see approach  \nto monetary policy in 2020.  \n\n•  The low-yield environment may \nencourage income-oriented \ninvestors to take increased risks. \nWe suggest that investors fully \nunderstand the risks associated \nwith lower-rated fixed-income \nsecurities.\n\nWhat it means for investors\n\n•  We expect U.S. rates to decline \n\nmodestly from current levels and \nbelieve investors should consider \nshifting out on the maturity \nspectrum to add intermediate \nmaturities.\n\n•  We prefer higher-quality fixed-\n\nincome issues.\n\nFavored asset classes\n\n•  U.S. Taxable Investment Grade \n\nFixed Income\n\n \n\n \n\n― U.S. Short Term Taxable\n\n―  U.S. Intermediate Term \n\nTaxable\n\nFavored fixed-income sectors\n\n•  U.S. Investment Grade Credit\n\n•  Preferred Securities\n\n•  Residential Mortgage-Backed \n\nSecurities\n\nPlease see pages 22 to 24 for important notes, definitions, and risk considerations.\n\n2020 Outlook |  11\n\n\x0cBright spots amid a neutral overall outlook  \n\nGlobal real assets\n\nJohn LaForge\nHead of Real Asset Strategy\n\nAustin Pickle, CFA\nInvestment Strategy Analyst\n\nIn 2020—it\'s the economy\n\nWe expect slow but positive global economic growth to be the prevailing factor \ninfluencing real assets in 2020 and therefore suspect that commodities will be \nneutral performers. There will be exceptions, of course. Oil may have some \nupside potential, as global geopolitical risk remains high and we suspect that U.S. \ncrude-oil production growth may slow somewhat. In our view, global real estate \ninvestment trusts (REITs) will be challenged by slowing economic growth, and \nlow interest rates may not be quite the tailwind they were in 2019. We expect \nmaster limited partnerships (MLPs) to perform well in 2020, generally \noutperforming both REITs and commodities. \n\nCommodities seem set for a modest recovery\n\nWe expect commodity prices, in general, to rebound modestly in 2020, after \nmixed performance in 2019. Industrial metals (excluding nickel) and agriculture \nwere hit the hardest in 2019 and should end 2020 near current levels. For \nprecious metals to have a repeat of their strong 2019 performance, we likely \nwould need to see a good deal more negative-yielding debt globally. \nCommodities generally may be most affected by some combination of a weaker \nU.S. dollar, the de-escalation of the China trade dispute, and lower long-term \ninterest rates. Our 2020 year-end target for the Bloomberg Commodity Index \n(total return) is 175, and we hold a neutral rating on commodities. This suggests a \nmid-single-digit 2020 return for this asset class.\n\nGeopolitical risk should support crude-oil prices\n\nCrude oil, and its energy derivatives such as gasoline, could outperform other \ncommodities in 2020. Our year-end 2020 target range for West Texas \nIntermediate (WTI) crude oil is $55 to $65 (with a $60 midpoint). This is roughly \n10% higher than the WTI price in the third quarter of 2019. We expect that the \nmain driver for U.S. crude-oil production will be slower economic growth in the \nmain oil-consuming countries. However, we expect additional price support \nfrom the volatile geopolitical backdrop in oil-producing countries.\n\nA moderate outlook for gold\n\nOur 2020 year-end target range for gold is $1,500 to $1,600, which suggests \nmodest upside potential. Global gold production growth has declined somewhat \nin recent years, which could provide a trigger for an upside move. The most \nimportant factor, however, likely will be the continued global buildup of \nnegative-yielding debt. With many developed market interest rates close to \nzero, or below it, investors could gravitate toward gold.\n\n12  |  2020 Outlook \n\nPlease see pages 22 to 24 for important notes, definitions, and risk considerations.\n\n\x0cNeutral on REITs, but favorable on MLPs \n\nKey takeaways\n\nWe enter 2020 with a neutral position for global REITs. We expect global REITs \nto continue to benefit from low interest rates and bouts of market angst. \nCurrently, REIT fundamentals are slowly weakening, valuations are stretched, \nlong-term interest rates are no longer in free fall, and the age of the economic \nexpansion is a concern. These competing forces have led us to our neutral view.\n\nIn Private Real Estate, we anticipate further pricing pressure as economic growth \nweakens. We favor sectors that can benefit from demographic trends, including \nmulti-family housing, senior living, and industrial. Public-to-private REIT \ntransactions could potentially become a significant driver of positive returns.\n\nBy contrast, MLPs lost ground to REITs when oil prices declined in mid-2019 \n(see chart below), which we interpret as a potential opportunity. MLP \nfundamentals appear solid: Yields are quite attractive, and the U.S. energy  \nboom continues. We believe that MLPs have finally turned the corner after a \nstring of years with unfavorable returns prior to 2019. We favor those that are \nlarge, broadly diversified, and well capitalized.\n\nMLP mid-2019 underperformance may offer an opportunity to add exposure\n\n•  We believe oil has approximately \n\nAlthough global REITs outperformed in 2019, we believe that MLPs likely will outperform \nboth REITs and commodities generally in 2020.\n\n120\n\n115\n\n110\n\n105\n\n100\n\ne\nu\n\n \n\nl\na\nv\nd\ne\nx\ne\nd\nn\nI\n\n95\nJan. 2019\n\nApril 2019\n\nJuly 2019\n\nOct. 2019\n\nCommodities\n\nMLPs\n\nGlobal REITs\n\n•  Our 2020 forecast is for \ncommodity prices to  \nrebound slightly, after  \nmixed performance in 2019.\n\n•  MLPs currently remain very cheap \nrelative to other high-yielding \ncategories, and fundamentals \nappear solid.

As yield-hungry investors gravitated to \nStructured Credit, spreads tightened while risks increased. This led us to \nmoderate our return expectations to be more in line with historical averages. \n\nWith that said, we anticipate that an allocation to Structured Credit strategies—\nespecially if combined with Long/Short Credit strategies—can potentially \nbenefit investors through diversification, income, and potential downside  \nrisk mitigation .\n\nThe Macro strategy has historically done well late in the cycle, and helped \nprovide diversification during periods of heightened volatility. We are becoming \nmore constructive on Systematic Macro strategies, especially those outside of \nthe traditional Trend Following category; we have upgraded our view to neutral  \nfrom unfavorable, as we expect to see a modest increase in volatility in 2020. \n\nDeal-focused strategies, such as Merger Arbitrage and Activist, may face \nchallenges as the election cycle and tariff negotiations could reduce corporate \nactivity. However, based on our expectations for an increase in the volume of \nstressed and distressed bonds, as well as an eventual increase in the default rate, \nwe maintain a favorable view for Event Driven strategies specializing in \ndistressed debt. While it is possible that stock correlations will increase slightly \nas volatility increases, we think 2020 will be good for stock pickers and \nmaintain our favorable view for Equity Hedge.\n\nPrivate Capital—we favor the niche and opportunistic\n\nMultiples remain higher than historical averages, currently reducing investors\' \nilliquidity premium in many large private equity buyout strategies. Furthermore, \nexit activity, especially initial public offerings (IPOs), may slow in 2020, \ndampening index returns and potentially lead to more public-to-private \ntransactions. However, we do see a broader opportunity for investors to raise \ntheir exposure to private equity, potentially deploying fresh capital into repriced \nmarkets. We also remain focused on geographic opportunities, primarily in Asia, \nas well as secondary funds for which both transaction volume and specialized \nopportunities we expect to continue to grow.  \n\nDirect lending and origination strategies should remain in focus, and Private \nDebt investors should consider navigating earnings adjustments and reduced \ncreditor protections.4 We anticipate growing opportunities for Distressed Debt \ninvesting, especially in cyclical sectors such as Information Technology. Finally, \nwe see continued opportunities to purchase assets from banks needing to \nadhere to regulatory guidelines to bolster their balance sheets.\n\n4.

Cash has a place in a portfolio\n\n Keeping cash above long-term target allocations just because markets are \nvolatile historically may have hindered many investors from achieving their \nlong-term goals. However, we believe cash alternatives can have a place in an \ninvestment portfolio for rebalancing and tactical opportunities. If the pattern \nof resilient markets continues this year as we expect, investors should find \nopportunities to take profits when markets exceed our price or yield target \nranges. There may also be chances to put cash back to work when political or \nother stresses push markets below our targets. By rebalancing in this way, \ncash can become a tactical tool that may enhance returns when market \nswings become more pronounced. \n\n When it comes to investing in an uncertain environment, we believe that \nquality matters at the asset-class and sector levels. For quality, we focus on \nU.S.-based large-cap companies with sizable cash positions, strong balance \nsheets, and growing dividends or share buybacks. Two equity sectors that \ncurrently share these characteristics are Information Technology and \nConsumer Discretionary. Within fixed income, we focus on reallocating fro\nlow-quality high yield to highly rated U.S. corporate bonds. \n\nm \n\n3.  Go beyond traditional fixed income for potential yield\n\n While today\'s low-rate environment could persist, we do see several \nopportunities to pick up potential yield beyond low U.S. Treasury rates. We \nfavor high-quality U.S. corporate bonds, residential mortgage-backed \nsecurities, and preferred securities. Outside of fixed income, investors can \nfind relatively attractive yields among international equities, which on \naverage have higher dividend yields today than U.S. equities, as well as in \nmore defensive sectors such as Consumer Staples, Real Estate, and Utilities, \nwhere we favor market-weight exposures. In addition, we continue to favor \nMLPs, where we see reasonable valuations and solid fundamentals.\n\n4.  Defense can be a good offense\n\n Hedge fund strategies that have the potential to profit in both up and down \nmarkets may provide a good alternative late in the economic expansion. \nOver the next few years, we favor Equity Hedge strategies. In addition, \ninvestors can play defense with their equity sector allocations. We are \ncurrently neutral on the defensive Consumer Staples, Real Estate, and \nUtilities sectors, and unfavorable on the Materials and Communications \nServices sectors, which we expect to underperform in a late-cycle economy.  \n\nAlternative investments are not suitable for all investors \nand are only open to ""accredited investors"" or ""qualified \ninvestors"" within the meaning of the U.S. securities laws. \nThey are speculative, highly illiquid, and designed for long-\nterm investment and not as trading vehicles.\n\n16  |  2020 Outlook \n\nPlease see pages 22 to 24 for important notes, definitions, and risk considerations.\n\n\x0c5.  Focus on longer-term diversification, as shorter\n\nperiods are likely to be volatile\n\n Given our expectation for economic, political, and monetary policy\nuncertainty in 2020, we favor positioning for heightened volatility. As\npainful as market downturns can be, they are a normal part of investing;\nhistorically, large-cap equities have experienced pullbacks of 5% or greater\nthree to four times per year and corrections of 10% or more every year or so.\nInvestors may reduce short-term volatility risk by using cash tactically,\nfocusing on high-quality assets, and positioning into more defensive asset\nclasses and sectors. We believe one of the best long-run approaches is to\ndiversify across a combination of low-correlated assets and regularly\nrebalance back to strategic targets (see the chart below).\n\nYearly returns of a diversified portfolio have been more volatile than  \n10-year returns\n\nThe range of returns from year to year is from -22.1% to 29.0%, but on a rolling 10-year \nbasis the range narrowed to 5.3% to 14.0%.

As such, a major downside \nrisk is if these rates spike higher.\n\n•  A significant and rapid \n\nimprovement in global economic \ngrowth leading to a further \nextension of the bull market would \nnegatively affect the relative \nperformance of hedge funds \ncompared with long-only \nbenchmarks.\n\n•  A loosening of bank lending could \nprolong the inception of the \ndefault cycle, postponing the \nopportunity for distressed debt \ninvestors. \n\nAlternative investments are not suitable for all investors \nand are only open to ""accredited investors"" or ""qualified \ninvestors"" within the meaning of the U.S. securities laws. \nThey are speculative, highly illiquid, and designed for long-\nterm investment and not as trading vehicles.\n\n2020 Outlook |  19\n\n\x0c2020 Focus theme\n\nEnvironmental, social, and corporate \ngovernance (ESG) investing\n\nKey questions we will  \naddress in this report\n\n•  What is ESG or  \n\n""responsible"" investing? \n\n•  How large is the ESG  \n\nmarket today?\n\n•  What factors are driving  \ndemand for responsible \ninvestment strategies?\n\n•  How might a responsible investing \n\napproach affect a portfolio\'s \nreturn potential?\n\nThis report will be available in Spring 2020.\n\nESG trends—investing with a purpose\n\nThere is growing investor interest in aligning portfolios with personal values, \nalso known as responsible investing. One way to potentially align investments \nwith this goal is through an investment approach that uses environmental, \nsocial, and corporate governance criteria. An ESG approach may focus on issues \nsuch as climate change, pollution control, gender and diversity, human rights, or \nboard composition. These issues are often interlinked, and it can be challenging \nto classify a single ESG-related concern as only environmental, social, or \ngovernance related.  \n\nThere is a misconception that ESG and responsible investing impose hurdles on \nperformance. To the contrary, studies suggest that, over the long term, ESG-\ndriven and responsible investment strategies historically have met or exceeded \nthe performance of comparable traditional investments on both an absolute and \na risk-adjusted basis.5\n\nResponsible investment strategies do come with certain risks. An investment\'s \nsocial policy may prohibit exposure to certain industries, companies, sectors, or \nregions, which could impede performance compared to similar investments that \nallow such exposure. We expect that the responsible investment choices \navailable will continue to expand. In our view, ESG factors could become \nstandard investment strategy components, particularly for those investors who \nseek greater transparency.\n\n5.

Moreover, as \nthe chasm between the parties widened, the percentage of voters who identify as \npolitical independents has risen significantly, especially during the past five \nyears.6 \n\n6. ""Party Affiliation,"" Gallup, November 11, 2019. The percentage of self-identified political independents has averaged 41% in Gallup \n\npolls since January 1, 2015, up five percentage points over the January 1, 2004–December 31, 2014, average.\n\nPolitical polarization: Politics and populism\n\nIdeological polarization has grown between Republicans and Democrats in the  \npast 50 years.\n\n116th Congress (2019–2021)\n\n101st Congress (1989–1991)\n\n91st Congress (1969-1971)\n\ns\ns\ne\nr\ng\nn\no\nC\nn\n\n \n\ni\n \ny\ng\no\n\nl\n\no\ne\nd\nI\n \nl\na\nc\ni\nt\ni\nl\n\no\nP\n \nf\no\nn\no\n\n \n\ni\nt\nu\nb\n\ni\nr\nt\ns\ni\nD\n\n-1\n\nMore liberal\n\n0\n\nDemocrat\n\nRepublican\n\n1\nMore conservative\n\nBeyond the partisan divide, other issues also make the 2020 elections \nsimultaneously difficult to predict and potentially significant. For example, the \nU.S. economy appears to be late in its economic expansion and an economic \nrecession could follow a political shock, either during the campaign season or \nafter the new government is seated. Finally, and not least, international relations \nare going through arguably their most significant adjustments since the end of \nthe Cold War in the early 1990s. What the candidates say and what the new \nleaders do regarding foreign affairs could imply more than the usual amount of \nchange in the economy and in market sentiment. \n\nKey questions we will address  \nin this series of reports\n\n•  What should investors pay \nattention to during the \npresidential debates?\n\n•  How might political parties\' \n\npositions on the issues affect  \nour asset-class and equity  \nsector ratings?\n\n•  Should voters rely on opinion \n\npolls? What role might big data \nand social media play in \ndetermining polling results and \nvoter turnout?\n\n• \n\nIs a single party likely to dominate \nin races across the Senate, the \nHouse, and the White House? \n\nA series of reports throughout the year will \ncover election insights and potential impacts. \n\nSources: Jeffrey B.

There can be no assurance that any investment strategy will be successful and meet its investment objectives. Investments fluctuate\nchanges in market and economic conditions and in different environments due to numerous factors, some of which may be unpredictable. Asset allocation and diversification do not guarantee invest\nreturns or eliminate risk of loss. Each asset class has its own risk and return characteristics, which should be evaluated carefully before making any investment decision. The level of risk associated with\nparticular investment or asset class generally correlates with the level of return the investment or asset class might achieve. Some of the risks associated with the representative asset classes include:\n\n with \nment \n a \n\nGeneral market risks\nStock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile. A stock\'s value may fluctuate in response to general economic and market conditions, the prospects of individual companies, and industry \nsectors. International investing has additional risks including those associated with currency fluctuation, political and economic instability, and different accounting standards. This may result in \ngreater share price volatility. These risks are heightened in emerging markets. Investing in small- and mid-cap companies involves additional risks, such as limited liquidity and greater volatility.\nInvestments in fixed-income securities, including municipal securities, are subject to market, interest rate, credit, liquidity, inflation, prepayment, extension, and other risks. Bond prices fluctuate \ninversely to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a general rise in interest rates can result in a decline in the bond\'s price. High-yield fixed-income securities are considered speculative, involve greater \nrisk of default, and tend to be more volatile than investment-grade fixed-income securities. Municipal securities may also be subject to the alternative minimum tax and legislative and regulatory risk, \nwhich is the risk that a change in the tax code could affect the value of taxable or tax-exempt interest income. If sold prior to maturity, fixed-income securities are subject to market risk. All fixed-\nincome investments may be worth less than their original cost upon redemption or maturity.\nSimilar to bonds, preferred securities are interest rate sensitive. Their dividends are not guaranteed and are subject to change. Some preferred securities include a call provision, which may negatively \naffect the return of the security. A prerefunded bond is a callable bond collateralized by high-quality securities, typically Treasury issues. U.S. government securities are backed by the full faith and \ncredit of the federal government as to payment of principal and interest if held to maturity. Although free from credit risk, they are subject to interest rate risk. Mortgage-related and asset-backed \nsecurities are subject to prepayment and call risks in addition to the risks of investing in debt securities. Call risk is the risk that the issuer will redeem the issue prior to maturity. This may result in \nreinvestment risk, which means the proceeds will generally be reinvested in a less favorable environment. Changes in prepayments may significantly affect yield, average life, and expected maturity.\nSustainable investing focuses on companies that demonstrate adherence to environmental, social and governance principles, among other values. There is no assurance that social impact can be an \neffective strategy under all market conditions. Different investment styles tend to shift in and out of favor. In addition, a fund\'s social policy could cause it to forgo opportunities to gain exposure to \ncertain industries, companies, sectors or regions of the economy which could cause it to underperform similar portfolios that do not have a social policy. In addition, there can be no guarantee that the \ncompanies invested in by a fund will exhibit positive or favorable ESG characteristics.\n\nSector investing\nSector investing can be more volatile than investments that are broadly diversified over numerous sectors of the economy and will increase a portfolio\'s vulnerability to any single economic, political, \nor regulatory development affecting the sector. This can result in greater price volatility. Communication services companies are vulnerable to their products and services becoming outdated because of \ntechnological advancement and the innovation of competitors. Companies in the communication services sector may also be affected by rapid technology changes; pricing competition, large equipment \nupgrades, substantial capital requirements and government regulation and approval of products and services. In addition, companies within the industry may invest heavily in research and development \nwhich is not guaranteed to lead to successful implementation of the proposed product. Risks associated with the Consumer Discretionary sector include, among others, apparel price deflation due to low-\ncost entries, high inventory levels and pressure from e-commerce players; reduction in traditional advertising dollars, increasing household debt levels that could limit consumer appetite for discretionary \npurchases, declining consumer acceptance of new product introductions, and geopolitical uncertainty that could affect consumer sentiment. Consumer Staples industries can be significantly affected \nby competitive pricing particularly with respect to the growth of low-cost emerging market production, government regulation, the performance of the overall economy, interest rates, and consumer \nconfidence. The Energy sector may be adversely affected by changes in worldwide energy prices, exploration, production spending, government regulation, and changes in exchange rates, depletion of \nnatural resources, and risks that arise from extreme weather conditions. Investing in the Financial services companies will subject a investment to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting \nthe sector. Some of the risks associated with investment in the Health Care sector include competition on branded products, sales erosion due to cheaper alternatives, research and development risk, \ngovernment regulations and government approval of products anticipated to enter the market. There is increased risk investing in the Industrials sector. The industries within the sector can be significantly \naffected by general market and economic conditions, competition, technological innovation, legislation and government regulations, among other things, all of which can significantly affect a portfolio\'s \nperformance. Materials industries can be significantly affected by the volatility of commodity prices, the exchange rate between foreign currency and the dollar, export/import concerns, worldwide \ncompetition, procurement and manufacturing and cost containment issues. Real estate investments have special risks, including possible illiquidity of the underlying properties, credit risk, interest rate \nfluctuations, and the impact of varied economic conditions. Risks associated with the Technology sector include increased competition from domestic and international companies, unexpected changes in \ndemand, regulatory actions, technical problems with key products, and the departure of key members of management. Technology and Internet-related stocks smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be \nmore volatile than the overall market. Utilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates, and the securities within the sector can be volatile and may underperform in a slow economy.\n\nAlternative investments \nAlternative investments, such as hedge funds, private equity/private debt, and private real estate funds, are speculative and involve a high degree of risk that is suitable only for those investors who \nhave the financial sophistication and expertise to evaluate the merits and risks of an investment in a fund and for which the fund does not represent a complete investment program. They entail \nsignificant risks that can include losses due to leveraging or other speculative investment practices, lack of liquidity, volatility of returns, restrictions on transferring interests in a fund, potential \nlack of diversification, absence and/or delay of information regarding valuations and pricing, complex tax structures and delays in tax reporting, and less regulation and higher fees than mutual \nfunds. Hedge fund, private equity, private debt, and private real estate fund investing involve other material risks, including capital loss and the loss of the entire amount invested. A fund\'s offering \ndocuments should be carefully reviewed prior to investing. \nPrivate debt strategies seek to actively improve the capital structure of a company, often through debt restructuring and deleveraging measures. Such investments are subject to potential default, \nlimited liquidity, the creditworthiness of the private company, and the infrequent availability of independent credit ratings for private companies. Investing in distressed companies is speculative and \ninvolves a high degree of risk. Because of their distressed situation, these securities may be illiquid, have low trading volumes, and be subject to substantial interest rate and credit risks. Private capital \ninvestments are complex, speculative investment vehicles not suitable for all investors. They are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as registered investment products and engage in \nleverage and other aggressive investment practices. There is often limited (or even non-existent) liquidity and a lack of transparency regarding the underlying assets.\nHedge fund strategies, such as Arbritrage, Event Driven, Equity Hedge, Relative Value, Structured Credit, Long/Short Credit, and Discretionary Macro, may expose investors to the risks associated \nwith the use of short selling, leverage, derivatives, and arbitrage methodologies. Short sales involve leverage and theoretically unlimited loss potential because the market price of securities sold short \nmay continuously increase. The use of leverage in a portfolio varies by strategy. Leverage can significantly increase return potential but create greater risk of loss. Derivatives generally have implied \nleverage, which can magnify volatility and may entail other risks, such as market, interest rate, credit, counterparty, and management risks. Private capital investments are complex, speculative \ninvestment vehicles not suitable for all investors. They are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as registered investment products and engage in leverage and other aggressive investment \npractices. There is often limited (or even non-existent) liquidity and a lack of transparency regarding the underlying assets.\n\nReal assets \nReal assets are subject to the risks associated with real estate, commodities, MLPs, and other investments and may not be suitable for all investors. \nThe commodities markets, including investments in gold and other precious metals, are considered speculative, carry substantial risks, and have experienced periods of extreme volatility. Investing \nin a volatile and uncertain commodities market may cause a portfolio to rapidly increase or decrease in value, which may result in greater share price volatility. Investments in commodities may be \naffected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity. Products that invest in commodities \nmay employ more complex strategies, which may expose investors to additional risks. Investment in securities of MLPs involves certain risks that differ from an investment in the securities of a \ncorporation. MLPs may be sensitive to price changes in oil, natural gas, etc.; regulatory risk; and rising interest rates. A change in the current tax law regarding MLPs could result in the MLP being \ntreated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, which would reduce the amount of cash flows distributed by the MLP. In addition, there are certain tax risks associated with an investment \nin MLP units, and conflicts of interest may exist between common unitholders and the general partner, including those arising from incentive distribution payments. Other risks include the volatility \nassociated with the use of leverage, volatility of the commodities markets, market risks, supply and demand, natural and man-made catastrophes, competition, liquidity, market price discount from \nnet asset value, and other material risks. Investment in real estate securities includes risks, such as the possible illiquidity of the underlying properties, credit risk, interest rate fluctuations, and the \nimpact of varied economic conditions.\n\n2020 Outlook |  23\n\n\x0cInvestment expertise and advice  \nto help you succeed financially\n\nWells\xa0Fargo Investment Institute is home to more than 120 investment \n\nprofessionals focused on investment strategy, asset allocation, portfolio \n\nmanagement, manager reviews, and alternative investments.

Payout-based: We estimate net total payout \n\ndiscount model (DDM), under which expected \n\nyield (NTY) as the sum of current dividend \n\nreal return is approximately the sum of \n\nyield and smoothed net buyback yield. To this \n\ndividend yield (DY), expected trend growth (g) \n\nwe add an estimate of long-term real growth of \n\nin real dividends or earnings per share (EPS), \n\nand expected change in valuation (∆v), that \nis: E(r) ≈ DY+g+∆v. We take the average of two \napproaches,3 described below. We assume no \n\nchange in valuations, i.e., no mean reversion \n\nfrom today’s (mostly high) valuations towards \nhistorical averages.4\n\naggregate payouts that includes net issuance. \nThis growth estimate, gTPagg, is an average \nof smoothed historical aggregate earnings \n\ngrowth and forecast GDP growth. So our \n\npayout-based expected return is: E(r) ≈ NTY + \ngTPagg, where NTY = DY + net buyback yield (NBY)\n\nMost estimates fell slightly during 2020 (after \n\n1.  Earnings-based: We start from the inverse \n\na rising in the first quarter), with Europe \n\nof the CAPE ratio (cyclically-adjusted P/E), \n\nand Australia seeing the biggest falls - see \n\nwhich is 10-year average inflation-adjusted \n\nExhibit\xa03. Our U.S. return estimate of 3.8% \n\nearnings divided by today’s price. We multiply \n\nover inflation remains low by historical \n\nby 0.5 (roughly the U.S. long-run dividend \n\nstandards.\n\npayout ratio), and add real earnings growth of \n\n1.5% (roughly the U.S. long-run average). So \nearnings-based expected return5 is: E(r) ≈ 0.5* \nAdjusted Shiller E/P + gEPS\n\n3  See the 2017 edition and its online appendix for details and discussion of the methodology.\n4  See the 2015 edition for a discussion of mean reversion in stock and bond valuations and our decision to exclude it. In short, our \n\nanalysis suggests mean reversion is unreliable and difficult to forecast, and there are plausible arguments for yields remaining lower \nthan historical levels.\n\n5  For our earnings-based estimate, we apply a 50% payout ratio to all countries, and use g = 1.5% for all countries except for emerging \nmarkets, where we use a higher growth rate of 2%. Adjusted Shiller  EP is Shiller EP * 1.075 where the scalar accounts for average \nearnings growth during the 10-year earnings window of the Shiller EP.\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nCapital Market Assumptions for Major Asset Classes  |  1Q21 \n\n5\n\nExhibit 3: Expected Local Returns for Equities\nDecember 2020\n\n1.

For earnings yield, U.S. is based on S&P 500; U.K. on FTSE 100 Index; Eurozone is a cap-\nweighted average of large-cap indices in Germany, France, Italy, Netherlands and Spain; Japan is Topix Index; and “Emerging Markets” is \nMSCI Emerging Markets Index.

The hypothetical performance results contained herein represent the application of the \nquantitative models as currently in effect on the date first written above, and there can be no assurance that the models will remain the \nsame in the future or that an application of the current models in the future will produce similar results because the relevant market and economic \nconditions that prevailed during the hypothetical performance period will not necessarily recur.

Estimates and methodology subject to change and based on data as of December 31, \n2021. See main text above for methodology. For earnings yield, U.S. is based on S&P 500; U.K. on FTSE 100 Index; Eurozone is a cap-\nweighted average of large-cap indices in Germany, France, Italy, Netherlands and Spain; Japan is Topix Index; and “Emerging Markets” is MSCI \nEmerging Markets Index. Net buyback yield is past 10-year average. For payout-based estimates, all countries are based on corresponding \nMSCI indices. “Global Developed” is a cap-weighted average. For emerging markets, payout-based estimate is dividend yield + forecast GDP \nper capita growth. Excess-of-cash return is calculated by subtracting real cash return estimates described later in the article. Hypothetical \nperformance results have certain inherent limitations, some of which are disclosed in the back. Estimates are for illustrative purposes only, are not \na guarantee of performance and are subject to change. \n\n4  See the 2017 edition and its online appendix for details and discussion of the methodology.\n5  See the 2015 edition for a discussion of mean reversion in stock and bond valuations, and our decision to exclude it. Our analysis \nsuggests the timing of any mean reversion is difficult to forecast, and there are plausible arguments for yields remaining below \nhistorical levels.\n\n6  For our earnings-based estimate, we apply a 50% payout ratio to all countries, and use g = 1.5% for all countries except for emerging \nmarkets, where we use a higher growth rate of 2%. Adjusted Shiller EP is Shiller EP * 1.075 where the scalar accounts for average \nearnings growth during the 10-year earnings window of the Shiller EP.\n\n\x0cCapital Market Assumptions for Major Asset Classes  |  1Q22 \n\n5\n\nGovernment Bonds\n\nGovernment bonds’ prospective medium-\n\nexpectations versus investment objectives, \n\nterm nominal total returns are strongly \n\nexcess-of-cash returns are more relevant for \n\nanchored by their yields.

Estimates as of December 31, 2021 are USD-denominated total nominal annual arithmetic rates of return. “Non-U.S. \ndeveloped equities” is cap-weighted average of Euro-5, Japan, U.K., Australia and Canada, unhedged. U.S. and Non-U.S. Treasuries are \nrepresented by the respective Bloomberg Barclays indices. Global 60/40 is a 60%/40% weighted average of the developed equities listed \nabove and developed government bonds listed above, respectively. Estimates are for illustrative purposes only, are not a guarantee of \nperformance and are subject to change. \n\nSources and Methodology for Long-Term Historical Expected Returns \n\nSources for historical equity and bond expected returns are AQR, Robert Shiller’s data \nlibrary, Kozicki-Tinsley (2006), Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Blue Chip Economic \nIndicators, Consensus Economics and Morningstar. Prior to 1926, stocks are represented by a \nreconstruction of the S&P 500 available on Robert Shiller’s website which uses dividends and \nearnings data from Cowles and associates, interpolated from annual data. After that, stocks are \nthe S&P 500. Bonds are represented by long-dated Treasuries. The equity yield is a 50/50 mix \nof two measures: 50% Shiller E/P * 1.075 and 50% Dividend/Price + 1.5%. Scalars are used to \naccount for long term real Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth. Bond yield is 10-year real Treasury \nyield minus 10-year inflation forecast as in Expected Returns (Ilmanen, 2011), with no rolldown \nadded.\n\nMethodology for Forecast Error Analysis (Exhibit 1)\n\nWe first produce historical time series of yield-based estimates for U.S. equities and U.S. \nTreasuries using the method described in the previous paragraph (analysis starts in 1900, but we \nuse data from 1870s onwards). We test their predictive power using quarterly overlapping 10-year \nperiods since 1900 and measure the distribution of errors. See the 2018 edition for more details. \nError ranges in Exhibit 1 are based on interquartile ranges of these distributions, adjusted for \ncurrent volatility estimates.\n\n\x0c16 \n\nCapital Market Assumptions for Major Asset Classes  |  1Q22\n\nDisclosures\n\nImportant Disclosures \n\nThis document has been provided to you solely for information purposes and does not constitute an offer or solicitation of an offer or any \nadvice or recommendation to purchase any securities or other financial instruments and may not be construed as such.

Payout-based: We estimate net total payout \n\ndiscount model, under which expected real \n\nyield (NTY) as the sum of current dividend \n\nreturn is approximately the sum of dividend \n\nyield and smoothed net buyback yield (NBY). \n\nyield (DY), expected trend growth (g) in real \n\nTo this we add an estimate of long-term real \n\ndividends or earnings per share (EPS), and \n\nexpected change in valuation (∆v), that is: \nE(r) ≈ DY+g+∆v. We take the average of two \napproaches,4 described below. We assume no \nmean reversion in valuations, i.e., ∆v=0.5\n\n1.  Earnings-based: The inverse of the CAPE \n\ngrowth of aggregate payouts that includes \nnet issuance. This growth estimate, gTPagg, is \nan average of smoothed historical aggregate \n\nearnings growth and forecast GDP growth. \n\nSo our payout-based expected return is: \nE(r)\xa0≈\xa0NTY + gTPagg, where NTY = DY + NBY\n\nratio (cyclically-adjusted P/E) is 10-year \n\nThis year we add U.S. small cap to our line-up \n\naverage inflation-adjusted earnings divided by \n\nand split out China from the emerging markets \n\ntoday’s price. We multiply this by 0.5 (roughly \n\nregion. Most real return estimates fell in 2023 \n\nthe U.S. long-run dividend payout ratio) and \n\ndue to rising valuations (see Exhibit 3). Excess \n\nadd real earnings growth of 1.5% (roughly \n\nreturns have shrunk for a second year due to \n\nfurther rises in cash estimates.\n\nthe U.S. average since 1900).

We approach this question by using public credit as an anchor, and then asking how \nprivate credit might differ (similar to our approach for private equity, where we consider differences versus \npublic equity). \n\nOf course, individual managers may deliver alpha by avoiding losses via informed security selection, \nloan structuring, and otherwise maximizing recoveries. But here we are interested only in industry-wide \ndifferences. Why might private credit’s long-term risk-adjusted return be…\n\nIlliquidity premium\n\n \nHigher?\n \n •\n \n \n • Borrower pays premium for flexibility and certainty \n \n \n • Disintermediation of banks\n \n • Lower defaults / more efficient workouts when \n \n\nof execution \n\nproblems arise\n\nLower?\n • Higher and opaque fees\n • Overpaying for price smoothing and/or \n\nembedded leverage\n\n • Possible latent deterioration in credit quality\n\nIdeally we would test these drivers empirically over long periods, but private credit data are limited. Munday \net al. (2018, results updated 2020) find private credit funds in aggregate have matched the performance \nof leveraged loan or high yield index benchmarks, with beta of 1 to 1.2 and alpha near zero. In other words, \nhigher fees and investor price smoothing preferences appear to have fully offset any illiquidity premium. For \nthese theoretical and empirical reasons, our proposed CMA framework for private credit (see table below) \nmirrors public high yield credit with two modifications:\n\n1.  We model floating-rate debt by subtracting the duration component of the expected return and risk, \n\nreflecting a common characteristic of the private credit marketplace.\n\n2.  We adjust for a survey-based estimate of average industry leverage, which magnifies both excess \n\nreturn and volatility projections. \n\nIndustry-wide private debt modification rates are similar to average default rates for single-B listed credit, \nhence the choice of a high yield proxy (see table footnote). Investors can apply their own estimates of \nleverage and credit quality, which will impact both risk and return estimates.\n\nModeling Private Credit as Floating-Rate Levered High Yield Corporate Bonds\n\nExcess Return (spread * haircut + roll)\n\n \n\nVolatility\n\nSharpe Ratio\n\nTotal Nominal Return (AM)\n\nTotal Nominal Return (GM)\n\nReal Return (GM)\n\nU.S. HY Credit Excess \n\nLeverage Multiplier\n\nPrivate Credit\n\n1.8%\n\n8.4%\n\n0.22\n\n6.0%\n\n5.6%\n\n3.4%\n\nx 1.2\n\nx 1.2\n\n2.2%\n\n10.1%\n\n0.22\n\n6.3%\n\n5.8%\n\n3.6%\n\nSource: Bloomberg, Block et al.

In the 1900s, they were \n\nriskless rate. This building-block approach is \n\nusually based on historical average total or \n\nexcess-of-cash returns, implicitly assuming \n\nappealing but fails if risk premia themselves \ndepend on the risk-free rate.23\n\nthat risk premia are constant over time. \n\nIn the 2000s, academics and practitioners \n\nExhibit 9 illustrates the key choices in \n\nincreasingly proposed that expected asset \n\ndeveloping CMAs, resulting in four alternative \n\nreturns vary over time and are best estimated \n\nmethods. The most important choice is \n\nfrom forward-looking metrics like yields and \nmarket valuations.22\n\nwhether to assume constant or time-varying \n\nexpected returns, and thus whether to rely on \n\nhistorical average returns or current market \n\nForward-looking approaches are often related \n\nyields.

There are, of \n\nexample, decomposing stock returns into \n\ncourse, many other more granular decisions—\n\ndividend income, growth, and valuation \n\nfor example, how to estimate yield and growth \n\nchanges.

In practice, these yield measures have some empirical ability to predict both future growth, short-rate and default \nevolution and future excess returns on equities, bonds and credit, so they reflect some (debatable) blend of market expectations and \ntime-varying risk premia.

Farmer-Nakamura-Steinsson (2023) \nhighlight the pernicious impact of gradual structural changes because we learn about them so slowly. These include gradually drifting \nasset yields and lower trading costs.\n\n25  Note that this approach still assumes constant premia—it just corrects historical average returns for a biased sample with measurable \n“unexpected returns”. Even after adjusting for a secular decline in yields, this approach gives a higher estimate than a yield-based \napproach anchored to the lower yield at the end of the sample (see Exhibit 10).\n\n26  The zero valuation change or ‘random walk’ assumption implies current valuations are sustainable, and that any deviation from \n\nhistorical averages reflects structural change. This approach still assigns low expected returns to expensive markets via the carry \nchannel (low starting yields), but it does not apply a further penalty by assuming yields normalize over the CMA horizon. It is true \nthat historical evidence supports slow mean reversion over multi-year horizons, but the effect is weak, possibly offset by gradual \nstructural changes, and it is highly debatable which historical mean is relevant (say, the past 20 years or a century?). Note that one \ncould also assume the opposite of mean reversion, momentum, but empirical evidence supports this assumption only at short horizons \nup to a year. \n\n\x0c \n\nAlternative Thinking 2024 Issue 1: Capital Market Assumptions for Major Asset Classes \n\n13\n\nExhibit 10: Point-in-Time Expected Real Return Estimates for U.S. Equities  \nJanuary 1, 1980 – December 31, 2023, based on expanding data since January 1960\n\nn\nr\nu\nt\ne\nR\n\n \nl\n\na\ne\nR\n\n \n\nd\ne\nt\nc\ne\np\nx\nE\n\n16%\n\n14%\n\n12%\n\n10%\n\n8%\n\n6%\n\n4%\n\n2%\n\n0%\n\n-2%\n\n-4%\n\n7.3\n\n3.1\n\n1980\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\n2020\n\nHistorical Average\n\nYield-Based Estimate\n\nSubsequent 10Y Realized Real Return\n\nHistorical Average Bias-Adjusted\n\nYield-Based with Mean Reversion\n\nSources: Bloomberg, Robert Shiller data library, Consensus Economics, AQR.

Estimates are for illustrative purposes only, are not a guarantee \nof performance and are subject to change. Not representative of any portfolio that AQR currently manages.\n\nSources and Methodology for Long-Term Historical Expected Returns \n\nSources for historical equity and bond expected returns are AQR, Robert Shiller’s data \nlibrary, Kozicki-Tinsley (2006), Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Blue Chip Economic \nIndicators, Consensus Economics and Morningstar. Prior to 1926, stocks are represented by a \nreconstruction of the S&P 500 available on Robert Shiller’s website which uses dividends and \nearnings data from Cowles and associates, interpolated from annual data. After that, stocks are \nthe S&P 500. Bonds are represented by long-dated Treasuries. The equity yield is a 50/50 mix \nof two measures: 50% Shiller E/P * 1.075 and 50% Dividend/Price + 1.5%. Scalars are used to \naccount for long term real Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth. Bond yield is 10-year real Treasury \nyield minus 10-year inflation forecast as in Expected Returns (Ilmanen, 2011), with no rolldown \nadded.\n\nMethodology for Forecast Error Analysis (Exhibit 1)\n\nNot only are the return forecasts uncertain, but also any measures of forecast uncertainty are \ndebatable. Forecasting requires humility at many levels. We first produce historical time series \nof yield-based estimates for U.S. equities and U.S. Treasuries using the method described in \nthe previous paragraph (analysis starts in 1900, but we use data from 1870s onwards). We test \ntheir predictive power using quarterly overlapping 10-year periods since 1900 and measure the \ndistribution of errors. See the 2018 edition for more details. Error ranges in Exhibit 1 are based \non interquartile ranges of these distributions, adjusted for current volatility estimates. \n\n\x0c16 \n\nAlternative Thinking 2024 Issue 1: Capital Market Assumptions for Major Asset Classes\n\nDisclosures\n\nThis document has been provided to you solely for information purposes and does not constitute an offer or solicitation of an offer or \nany advice or recommendation to purchase any securities or other financial instruments and may not be construed as such.

ONE OF THE \nLIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF \nHINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING \nRECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY \nTO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL \nPOINTS THAT CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO \nTHE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM, WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY \nACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS, ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT \nACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. The hypothetical performance results contained herein represent the application of the quantitative \nmodels as currently in effect on the date first written above, and there can be no assurance that the models will remain the same in the \nfuture or that an application of the current models in the future will produce similar results because the relevant market and economic \nconditions that prevailed during the hypothetical performance period will not necessarily recur. Discounting factors may be applied to \nreduce suspected anomalies. This backtest’s return, for this period, may vary depending on the date it is run. Hypothetical performance \nresults are presented for illustrative purposes only. In addition, our transaction cost assumptions utilized in backtests, where noted, are \nbased on AQR Capital Management LLC’s, (“AQR’s”) historical realized transaction costs and market data. Certain of the assumptions have \nbeen made for modeling purposes and are unlikely to be realized. No representation or warranty is made as to the reasonableness of the \nassumptions made or that all assumptions used in achieving the returns have been stated or fully considered.
