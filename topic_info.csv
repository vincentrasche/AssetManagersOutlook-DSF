Mocuta\nChief Economist\n\nFrom the outset of 2024, the economic environment proved more resilient than we had \nanticipated, with robust growth and inflation moderating at a slower-than-anticipated pace. \nHowever, price pressures eventually relented to open the door for major central banks to embark \non policy rate cuts. Against this backdrop, equity markets have delivered strong returns for the \nyear to date, with leading indexes hitting multiple record highs along the way. The robust data and \ndelayed start to rate cuts kept fixed income markets in flux, although returns for the period have \nso far been positive, if relatively modest.\n\nWe expect the narrative of rate cuts and resilience to hold in 2025, and for our projected soft \nlanding to materialize. This landscape extends our favorable outlook for equity markets, with US \nlarge caps remaining in pole position, although performance should broaden into small caps and \nemerging markets. Within fixed income, we expect government bonds across most advanced \neconomies to provide attractive returns, but credit seems fully priced at current spreads, albeit \nwith solid fundamentals.\n\nEmerging market debt offers value but investors need to be comfortable with a more volatile \npolicy and currency backdrop. This uncertainty will likely be a constant in 2025, as a new \nTrump administration takes shape and conflicts in Europe and the Middle East continue. This \npersistent volatility, coupled with higher equity-bond correlations, means that investors need to \nbroaden out beyond the traditional “60/40” portfolio and focus on risk/return, to deploy a range \nof approaches, strategies, and alternative asset classes to ensure their portfolios can achieve \nspecific investment objectives.\n\nWe explore these themes and more in our latest Global Market Outlook. \n\nGlobal Economic \nOutlook\n\nDespite the many twists and turns in the macroeconomic mood over the past year, the \nunderlying global story has remained largely the same. We have traveled further along the road \nof slowdown and disinflation that was always going to lead us to the interest rate cuts we see \nbeing implemented around the globe — Japan being a notable exception. We expect that this \nwill continue for a while longer, although the Trump-led Republican victory in the US elections \ncould result in some change to the narrative in the latter part of 2025 — more clarity on policy \noutcomes will be required before implementing forecast changes. But it is now not only possible, \nbut even likely, that not all four of the quarterly US rate cuts we anticipate in 2025 will materialize.\n\n    \n\n5\n\n\x0cFigure 1 \nCentral Banks Easing as \nInflation Subsides\n\n   Easing (Cutting Rates)\n\n   Unchanging (Holding Rates)\n\n   Tightening (Hiking Rates)\n\n   Global CPI Inflation,  \nMedian Weighted (RHS)\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nShort-Term  \nOutlook: A Lift From \nLower Rates\n\nShare (Percent)\n\n100\n\nPercent\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nDec\n1994\n\nMar\n1999\n\nJun\n2003\n\nSep\n2007\n\nDec\n2011\n\nMar\n2016\n\nJun\n2020\n\nNov\n2024\n\nSource: Macrobond, State Street Global Advisors Economics, World Bank, 34 developed and emerging market central \nbanks. Data as of October 21, 2024.\n\nA soft landing has been our long-standing forecast for the United States economy, but that view \nhas at times come under considerable threat. And while plenty of risks to the outlook remain, \nthree recent developments have combined to make us feel better about the economy’s near-\nterm prospects. First and foremost, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) has finally embarked on an \neasing cycle. Because we viewed the Fed staying “too high for too long” as the number one risk \nto the soft landing scenario, this is a significant and very positive development. Secondly, the \nBureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) announced a big upward revision to US national domestic \nincome such that the savings rate, previously estimated at about 3%, is now close to 5%. This \nin turn dampens the worries arising from the depletion of excess savings and rise in consumer \ndebt delinquencies that had weighed on the soft landing narrative. These two factors essentially \nextend the economy’s runway. Thirdly, China has announced considerable monetary stimulus \nand could add more fiscal supports as well. We do not see these measures as true game \nchangers and question the value of defending a certain growth target, but they reduce downside \nrisks in the world’s second-largest economy and help ease near-term risks more broadly.\n\nSo, the economic road ahead looks a little smoother in the near term. The US election outcome \nmay add a further boost to 2025 growth on business expectations of a lighter regulatory burden, \nbut positives could be entirely mitigated should aggressive tariffs or deportation action stoke \ninflation pressures and keep the Fed on the sidelines. As investors shift from campaign rhetoric to \nanalyzing policy announcements, recurrent volatility episodes should not be surprising. Whether \nit’s the debt ceiling that comes back into play in January, the 2016 tax cuts that expire at the \nend of 2025, tariff or immigration policy changes, the triggers for market volatility will remain \nnumerous even after the new president is inaugurated.\n\nIn relative terms, the US outperformance of its developed market peers seems poised to \ncontinue; the Republicans’ victory in November’s US elections could sustain that for longer. \nThe competitive loss that the euro area suffered following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues \nto weigh on the region’s economy. Despite solid household finances and employment prospects, \nEuropean consumers appear unwilling to run down their excess savings to boost spending. \nA meaningful eurozone growth acceleration remains, for now, an unrealized potential.\n\n    \n\n6\n\n\x0cFor Japan, periods of enthusiasm for a clean break from the deflationary forces of the past \nhave given way to more cautious assessments of potential growth prospects in a country where \nthe demographic backdrop worsens year after year. Tight parliamentary arithmetic following \nOctober’s elections and ensuing political uncertainty ahead of Upper House elections in \n2025 further complicates the outlook. In many ways, the sustainability of Japan’s inflation and \ngrowth momentum remain an open question. Yet, international and domestic investors have \ndemonstrated greater confidence in Japan’s economy and markets in recent years, in part \nattracted by corporate reform efforts.\n\nMedium-Term \nOutlook: The Drag \nFrom Debt\n\nThe Covid pandemic unleashed a global tidal wave of fiscal expansion that helped blunt the \nextent of, and shorten the duration of, the ensuing recession. That fiscal boost was welcome, \nbut it cannot be sustained. Unsurprisingly, the fiscal trajectory has taken a more central \nrole in elections around the globe, including in France, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the \nUnited States.\n\nThe accompanying sharp increases in global debt service costs are likely to continue as the initial \nCovid stimulus occurred during extremely low (and even negative) interest rates. Refinancing \ncosts will thus increase even if policy interest rates come down from current levels. This is a \nparticularly relevant dynamic in the United States, where the potential effects of President-elect \nTrump’s expansionary fiscal plans are as yet unclear but could raise term premia. \n\nFigure 2 \nChange in Nominal  \nPublic Debt Since  \nJanuary 1, 2020\n\n   Central Government Debt\n\n100\n\nPercent\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n-40\n\n-60\n\ni\n\na\nn\nh\nC\n\nl\ni\nz\na\nr\nB\n\ni\n\na\nd\nn\n\nI\n\na\nc\ni\nr\nf\nA\nS\n\n \n\na\nd\na\nn\na\nC\n\na\ne\nr\no\nK\nS\n\n \n\ny\nn\na\nm\nr\ne\nG\n\nS\nU\n\nK\nU\n\ni\n\no\nc\nx\ne\nM\n\na\n\ni\nl\n\na\nr\nt\ns\nu\nA\n\ne\nc\nn\na\nr\nF\n\n \n\n7\n2\nU\nE\n\nn\na\np\na\nJ\n\nl\n\ny\na\nt\nI\n\nn\ne\nd\ne\nw\nS\n\nk\nr\na\nm\nn\ne\nD\n\nSource: Macrobond, State Street Global Advisors Economics Team. Data as of September 30, 2024.\n\nMarkets can also reflect their assessment of countries’ fiscal and debt sustainability pathways \nvia exchange rates (recall the pound’s plunge during the UK budget drama in October 2022). \nYet, in a world where “everyone is doing it,” investors’ ability to differentiate is somewhat \ndiminished. Depending on the fiscal pathway taken in the future, the implications for investors \ncould be starkly different. To further explore different scenarios around rising public debt levels, \nour recent articles expand on fiscal sustainability themes.\n\n    \n\n7\n\n\x0cGeopolitical \nOutlook\n\nElliot Hentov, Ph.D. \nHead of Macro \nPolicy Research\n\nFigure 3 \nShare of Leading  \nPatents & Research:  \nChina v US\n\n   US\n\n   China\n\n   Net US/China\n\nSlow-Moving \nFragmentation Continues\n\nThe core theme of global geopolitics remains geoeconomic fragmentation. While the world \neconomy may appear largely unchanged compared to the past few decades, this understates \nthe geopolitical forces that risk rupturing long-standing economic and financial ties. Reflecting \nthe shifting landscape, the twenty-first century is less focused on resource competition; territorial \nexpansion (e.g., World War II); or ideological alignment (e.g., Cold War). Instead, it centers on \npower dominance, with technological superiority a key factor in enabling the dominant bloc to \ndictate the global economic and political order.\n\nIn this regard, some modern technologies are profoundly different in that they do not represent \nincremental innovation, but rather a technological leap. They also do not lend themselves easily to \ndiffusion, meaning some technological advantages could become entrenched. We have attempted \nto quantify the position of different blocs in this technological race using the Critical Technology \nTracker developed by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. This tracker ranks patents and \nresearch levels across eight fields, and we have assigned a cumulative quantitative score in each \ncategory to compare the relative position of the two main antagonists, US and China.\n\nFigure 3 shows that in a direct bilateral comparison, China is well ahead of the US in all eight \nfields. However, that picture shifts dramatically when we include US allies from Europe and \nAsia-Pacific regions in the calculations, with China only remaining ahead in the two domains of \nrenewable energy and advanced materials.\n\nSensing, Timing & Navigation\n\n-15\n\n24\n\n40\n\nQuantum\n\n-22\n\n5\n\n27\n\nBiotechnology, Gene Technologies & Vaccines\n\n-21\n\n10\n\n31\n\nEnergy & Environment\n\nDefence, Space, Robotics & Transportation\n\nAdvanced Materials & Manufacturing\n\nAdvanced Information &  \nCommunication Technologies\n\n-10\n\n-16\n\n-12\n\n-12\n\n36\n\n46\n\n25\n\n41\n\n33\n\n44\n\n22\n\n34\n\nAI Technologies\n\n-18\n\n12\n\n30\n\n    \n\n8\n\n\x0cShare of Leading  \nPatents & Research: \nChina vs. US + US Allies\n\n   US + Core Allies\n\n   China\n\n   Net US + Allies/China\n\nSensing, Timing & Navigation\n\n-46\n\n-6\n\n40\n\nQuantum\n\n-58\n\n-31\n\n27\n\nEnergy & Environment\n\n-33\n\n12\n\nDefence, Space, Robotics \n& Transportation\n\nBiotechnology, Gene  \nTechnologies & Vaccines\n\n-45\n\n-5\n\n-49\n\n-18\n\nAdvanced Information &  \nCommunication Technologies\n\n-39\n\n-6\n\nAI Technologies\n\n-49\n\n-19\n\nAdvanced Materials & Manufacturing\n\n-36\n\n9\n\n44\n\n46\n\n41\n\n31\n\n34\n\n30\n\nSource: State Street Global Advisors Global Macro Policy using the Critical Technology Tracker of Australian Strategic \nPolicy Institute. Research publications mapped to 100 for US+China, then for US+China+Core US allies (UK, France, Japan, \nGermany, Italy), thus understating full alliance benefit accruing to Western technology complex. \n\nReal (Military) Wars \n\nThis overarching competition may be taking place in research laboratories, but it is being fought \nout in global channels that power the industrial-technological complex. These battles have \nmaterial implications for financial markets. We consider three main arenas of competition: Real \n(Military) Wars, Trade Wars, and Fiscal “Wars.” While one or other arena can go quiet for a time, \nthe fundamental drivers of increased friction remain intact and are unlikely to dissipate in 2025.\n\nWe believe it makes sense for Real Wars, i.e., global conflicts, to be viewed through the lens of \ngeopolitical bloc competition. Within limits, the Cold War is a useful analogy, though today’s \nmilitary alliances are looser and non-state actors play a more prominent role — the rationale \nof proxy wars as a tool to weaken the adversarial bloc still holds true. The wars in Ukraine and \nthe Middle East have had a devastating human cost, while also draining bloc resources and \neroding political capital. For example, support for Ukraine has involved the emptying of Western \narsenals. This means that wars in regions which are geographically remote or seem economically \ninsignificant could still matter for markets, mainly by drawing in major powers or through other \nspillover effects.\n\nThis should imply a broadly higher geopolitical risk premium, though we have thus far only seen \nit transmit into higher gold prices. And that too has direct linkages to conflict: the freezing of \nRussia’s central bank reserves and secondary sanctions on non-Russian entities has catalyzed \ndemand for gold among other central banks. Gold has long benefited from its status as a generic \ngeopolitical hedge, but the remarkable price gains in 2024 suggest that much has been priced \nin and Trump’s re-election poses short-term headwinds. In addition to gold, crisis periods \nmay encourage more episodic capital flows and potential appreciation of classic safe haven \ncurrencies, too.\n\n    \n\n9\n\n\x0cTrade Wars \n\nFigure 4 \nNew Trade \nInterventions Globally \n(2009–2023)\n\n   Harmful\n\n   Liberalising\n\nFiscal “Wars”\n\nWhen it comes to Trade Wars, the challenge is to identify where the cost of fragmentation will \nreside. As illustrated by Figure 4, trade disruption continues to rise, and it is not simply a function \nof tariffs. Non-tariff barriers and sectoral interventions are increasingly a factor and create \npressure to alter existing trade and capital relations. Trade between the US and China will likely \ncontinue to deteriorate, but the speed and magnitude of that will determine who will feel the pain \nof adjustment (and who might benefit). Higher US tariffs on Chinese imports imply a stronger \ndollar and a weaker renminbi, but emerging market currencies will not react in a uniform manner.\n\nAmong EM countries, we see trade as the greater differentiator. Some countries will retain \nfavorable trading conditions and become more competitive compared to Chinese exporters \n— Vietnam and Mexico have been beneficiaries of increased trade barriers since 2018. Other \ncountries could attract greater investment from Chinese firms seeking to re-route production \nto evade tariffs. But the outlook for these countries is not identical given the risk that ‘policy will \nchase trade’ — Chinese foreign direct investment today becomes a political liability tomorrow as \nthey attract punitive trade sanctions. It has become increasingly clear that what matters most is \nmembership in a trade bloc. \n\nSource: Global Trade Alert. Measures include tariffs, export-related measures, subsidies, contingent trade-protective \nmeasures and trade-related investment measures. \n\nLastly, we highlight the use of fiscal policy by governments to achieve their geopolitical aims. \nThe combination of domestic politics and geopolitics implies continued loose fiscal policy across \nlarge economies. Reduced trade reliance and greater security risks will require governments \nto secure supply chains, invest in new technologies, and increase military preparedness. Much \nof this spending may enjoy a high fiscal multiplier, as defense expenditures tend to be highly \nlocalized within blocs, and are manufacturing-intensive and cluster-reinforcing. Higher public \ncapital expenditure is likely to flow into energy and industrial infrastructure. As this spending \nsupports growth, some of the positive impulses could raise real rates as potential growth \nestimates improve. However, as discussed in our macroeconomic outlook, increased government \nspending will result in fiscal deficits unless spending in other areas is cut.\n\n    \n\n10\n\nNumber of Measures04,0003,5003,0002,5002,0001,5001,000500200920102011201220132014201520162023201720182019202020212022\x0cEquity Outlook\n\nSearching for Pockets \nof Opportunity \n\nDane Smith\nNorth American Head of \nInvestment Strategy & \nResearch\n\nTo expand on the famous quote by the investor Benjamin Graham, in the short run, the stock \nmarket acts like a voting machine, driven by sentiment and flows, while over the long run, it \nfunctions as a weighing machine with fundamentals and economic realities shaping market \ndirection.1 These dynamics are now particularly relevant, with global equity markets navigating \nshort-term uncertainties — such as the trajectory of policy rates and election outcomes — \nalongside deeper structural shifts like demographics, geoeconomic fragmentation, and the rise \nof transformative technologies. The impact of these forces on valuations and earnings shapes \nour view of equity return potential across geographies and sectors.\n\nUS Equities: \nMomentum \nMaintained\n\nWe anticipate that US Large Cap equity can maintain its structural advantage over developed \nmarkets (DM) equities. US companies continue to deliver on what the market values most — \nprofitability and earnings growth, driven mainly by the technology sector and the so-called \nMagnificent 7, in particular. Consensus earnings growth of 15% is estimated for 2025, and we \nexpect the positive momentum to continue against the backdrop of an economic soft landing.\n\nFurthermore, these earnings appear resilient to monetary policy moves, and could further benefit \nfrom political tailwinds. Net interest payments as a percentage of profits are at historical lows, \npreserving the profitability advantage of the United States, and the new Trump administration \nand Republican-led Congress could extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and adopt a more \nfavorable regulatory stance toward big tech.\n\nThis would support large caps but could also help broaden performance into more cyclical \nsectors, perhaps amid a renewed focus on traditional energy production or deregulation of \nfinancials, and help lift earnings growth in smaller names (Figure 5). Confidence levels among \nUS small businesses appear in a holding pattern — sentiment has moved sideways on hopes \nthat risks abate as post-election clarity emerges on areas of government policy and the path of \nmonetary policy. Should both prove favorable, and labor markets remain resilient, a bounce back \nin small caps could be on the horizon given relatively attractive valuations and the potential for \nhigher earnings growth.\n\n    \n\n11\n\n\x0cS&P 500\n\nS&P 500 Equal-Weight \nIndex\n\nMSCI AC World Ex-USA\n\nFigure 5 \nUS Maintains Its \nEarnings Advantage\nEPS % Growth Estimates\n\n   2024\n\n   2025\n\n9.78% 14.83%\n\n0.40%\n\n15.13%\n\n8.98%\n\n10.85%\n\nSource: S&P, MSCI, FactSet, State Street Global Advisors, as of October 8, 2024.\n\nValuations are often cited as a risk to the market’s progress, while the ongoing assessment \nof artificial intelligence (AI) and related themes present questions about momentum and \nmonetization of these high-profile technology advances. However, the S&P 500’s current price/\nearnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 1.5x, which is below the 10-year average.2 Meanwhile, the \nInformation Technology sector PEG of 1.7x is only slightly above the 10-year average, showing \nthe market isn’t that expensive relative to its growth potential. However, any misstep in earnings, \nparticularly from the top names, would be cause for concern.\n\nEuropean Equities: \nConsumer Remains \na Drag \n\nOn the surface, the European economy appears to have a lot going for it: Household savings rates \nare high, wage growth robust, unemployment low, and the effects of disinflation positive. However, \nthe economy is still lagging due to a combination of weak consumption, poor domestic demand, \nand low fixed investment driven by a dearth of confidence in the region’s growth prospects. \nAgainst this backdrop, earnings guidance has unsurprisingly been revised lower.\n\nChina’s woes provide another headwind as revitalizing Chinese domestic demand will take time, and \neven longer to transfer to the eurozone. This drag is particularly keenly felt in Germany, for whom \nChina is a major trading partner, and this is now compounded by fresh political uncertainty in Berlin.\n\nEven so, at roughly 10% earnings growth for 2025 and at a forward price/earnings (PE) multiple \nof 14x — which is below the five-year average — there is opportunity to be found in Europe. For \nthe eurozone, these opportunities may be found in global sectors such as Energy (attractively \npriced versus US counterparts), Health Care (Europe is home to leading global companies), and \nIndustrials (leaders in clean energy infrastructure), that are less exposed to consumer-related \nweakness in their domestic markets.\n\n    \n\n12\n\n\x0cJapanese Equities: \nWariness Warranted\n\nNotwithstanding recent success for Japan’s stock market, we anticipate a move sideways given \nthe potential for volatility as the market digests new unknowns. The strong tailwind from inflation \nand revitalized growth prospects that this year propelled Japan’s stock market through its 1989 \npeak may be fading. Instead, hawkish monetary policy and political uncertainty present new risks \nand could offset the positives that have largely been priced in. The expectation of higher bond \nyields and declining yen repatriation are also likely to put downward pressure on the equity risk \npremium, creating a shift in investor risk appetite to favor fixed income over equities, especially \namidst Japan’s political transition. Although Japanese equities have typically experienced relief \nrallies following general elections over the past decade, this time might differ should the prime \nminister’s post mimic the revolving door of recent predecessors. \n\nChinese Equities: \nStimulus Is a  \nShort-term Fix \n\nWhile providing a boost for the country’s stock market, China’s recently announced stimulus \nprovides only a short-term fix. It does little to address structural problems, causing us to doubt \nthe stamina of the rally. China’s chronically high debt levels, a housing overhang where consumers \nare 70% levered to the property market, and worsening demographics create structural \nissues that hurt consumer demand and sentiment. The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) plan to \nrecapitalize banks may not yield the long-term results it hopes for as the measures to date simply \naren’t sufficient to fix the underlying issue — a lack of demand as reflected by drying-up foreign \ndirect investment (Figure 6), weak domestic consumption, and below-target economic growth. \nUntil these core issues are addressed, we expect China to struggle in sustaining higher growth \nand strong equity market performance. \n\nFigure 6 \nDiminishing Attraction \nof China\n\n   China Foreign \nDirect Investment  \n(Year-on-Year % chg)\n\nPercent\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n-30\n\n-40\n\nAug\n2014\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJun\n2017\n\nNov\n2018\n\nApr\n2020\n\nSep\n2021\n\nFeb\n2023\n\nJul\n2024\n\nSource: Macrobond, China’s Ministry of Commerce as of August 31, 2024. \n\nEmerging Market \nEquities: Improving \nProspects\n\nEmerging markets look promising given economic growth potential, strong earnings growth \nestimates, and easing inflationary pressures. Falling interest rates, particularly in the US, could \nprovide additional tailwinds, although this does not always pan out as expected.\n\nGeopolitical risks will likely keep exuberance muted and the US dollar resilient, while economic \nfragmentation creates drag. Furthermore, despite attractive valuations, most emerging markets \nlack the high return on equity (ROE) and margins to excite investors. However, idiosyncratic \ncountry risks present opportunities for selective investors in broader emerging markets, which \nincludes profitable stocks with higher growth potential, particularly in smaller names, as investors \nrebuild an underweight position back to neutral.\n\n    \n\n13\n\n\x0cFixed Income \nOutlook\n\nFavorable Environment \nfor Sovereigns\n\nDesmond Lawrence\nSenior Investment Strategist\n\nWe retain our favorable outlook for fixed income assets as we move into 2025. Slowing economic \noutput and tame inflation will allow central banks to cut policy rates further, and while the pace \nand scale may be even more uncertain under a Trump administration, the direction appears \nclear. That uncertainty may offer investors tactical opportunities to build or expand their duration \npositioning through the easing cycle.\n\nSovereign Bonds\n\nWe expect government bonds across most advanced economies to provide attractive returns \nas central banks can worry somewhat less about inflation and more fully align policy rates with \nweakening domestic demand and international activity. Short-term interest rate markets have \npriced in a soft landing with policy rates expected to fall towards 3.75% in the US and below \n2.0% in the euro area. As rate cuts materialize, yield curves will be pulled lower, led by the short \nend in the classic bull steepening trade. Duration exposure is important, however: history shows \nus that rewards are typically much greater further out the curve as the cutting cycle begins \n(Figure 7). The journey will not be smooth, however, with the Treasury market fluctuating with \npolicy pricing in federal funds futures and the evolving fiscal and trade policies of the incoming \nTrump administration. The direction of travel is clear though, and this opens the door for \ninvestors to get to their desired duration positioning at relatively attractive prices. One notable \nexception among the advanced economies is Japan, particularly for short-dated government \ndebt given the different policy imperatives and direction.\n\n30\n\nCumulative Return (%)\n\nFed Funds Target Rate (%)\n\nFigure 7 \nDuration Rewarded as \nRates Are Cut\n\n   1–3 Year US Treasury\n\n  5–7 Year US Treasury\n\n  7–10 Year US Treasury\n\n   Fed Funds Target \nRate (RHS)\n\n26.4\n25.0\n\n14.8\n\n23.8\n\n20.3\n\n9.2\n\n11.9\n\n9.2\n\n4.0\n\n2000\n\n2004\n\n2008\n\n2012\n\n2016\n\n2020\n\n2024\n\nSource: Bloomberg Finance L.P.

This varies by country in line \nwith current absolute yield levels; in that respect, US Treasuries look comparatively more \nattractive versus core eurozone bonds, where the starting position is very different and thus \noffer more moderate returns. A harder landing would amplify returns — potentially into double-\ndigit territory.\n\nSubstantial fiscal deficits and debt levels remain a distinct, and so far unaddressed, challenge. \nWhile the US captures most of the attention, especially considering the election result, aging \npopulations make this just as pressing an issue in Europe and Asia. This represents the most \nobvious risk to an otherwise encouraging outlook.\n\nInvestment Grade \nCredit\n\nWith investment grade (IG) spreads close to historic lows, there is little prospect of further spread \ncompression from here (Figure 8). Average credit fundamentals are still solid, but it seems \nreasonable to expect some deterioration in balance sheet strength and interest coverage as \nthe credit cycle progresses. Indeed, there are already signs of this: although leverage among \nUS non-financials has declined from its pandemic-era high it has risen once again from recent \nlows. Meanwhile, profit margins at those non-financials have recently reached an all-time high — \nunless that trend continues, it seems unlikely that interest coverage for this segment can improve \nand may weaken further.\n\n700\n\nBasis Points\n\nFigure 8 \nInvestment Grade  \nSpreads Have Tightened\n\n   US IG Corporate Spread\n\n  EUR IG Corporate Spread\n\n   US IG Median Spread\n\n   EUR IG Median Spread\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n2004\n\n2006\n\n2008\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\n2014\n\n2016\n\n2018\n\n2020\n\n2022\n\n2024\n\nSource: Bloomberg Finance L.P. Data as of November 1, 2024. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of \nfuture performance. \n\n    \n\n15\n\n\x0cHigh Yield Debt\n\nWe see high yield debt in a broadly similar position to its IG counterpart. With spreads at their tightest \nlevels since 2007, returns will be driven more by declining underlying yields rather than further \nsignificant spread compression. Having previously faced legitimate concerns around an approaching \nmaturity wall in the face of relatively high prevailing yields, many issuers have taken advantage of \nlower yields and tight spreads since then to refinance, thereby improving the technical outlook. This \nopportunistic refinancing has been more of a US dollar market phenomenon so far. That said, the fall \nin yields and tighter spreads are more widespread and those improved refinancing conditions could \nyet provide the same opportunity for euro (and other) issuers.\n\nEmerging Market Debt \n\nAlthough hard currency emerging market (EM) debt spreads have narrowed, most credit events \nhave been priced in and a positive outlook for US Treasuries means that this debt segment has \nscope to add value for investors. Additionally, the turn in the US rate cycle should — in time — \nweaken another support for the external value of the dollar, which in turn would bolster sentiment \ntowards emerging market assets.\n\nThat same US rate cycle dynamic can also support an easing in domestic policy rates across \nemerging markets, with positive implications for local currency (LC) EM debt as well. This will be \nnuanced however — individual LC issuers currently face very different inflation pressures and \ndomestic conditions, so we cannot assume that all the regions will be able to deliver a similar \nlevel of policy accommodation in the coming quarters. For example, China — a local currency \nheavyweight — has the resources to boost domestic demand, but the efficacy of current and \npotential future support is unclear.\n\nAs noted above, the evolving policy stance of the incoming Trump administration may have a \nbearing on US Treasury yields and the US dollar, with implications for both EM debt segments. \nDepending on how targeted they are, protectionist US trade policies could have significant \nconsequences for sentiment towards individual countries.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWe see a generally favorable environment for advanced economy sovereign debt. As fiscal, trade \nand monetary policies evolve, we expect to see swings in sentiment and bouts of volatility — \npotentially creating opportunities for investors to manage or extend duration. Credit investors \nfaced with limited scope for further spread compression and a maturing credit cycle can also \nexpect dispersion and volatility — a fruitful regime for an active approach to credit.\n\n    \n\n16\n\n\x0cPortfolio \nConstruction\n\nBeyond 60/40: \nImproving Durability \nand Diversification \nin Portfolios \n\nMatthew Bartolini, CFA, \nCAIA\nHead of SPDR \nAmericas Research\n\nA high level of co-movement between stocks and bonds, and equity concentration risks, are two \nfactors limiting the 60/40 (stocks/bonds) portfolio’s durability during a time of idiosyncratic and \nasymmetric macro trends. In fact, the rolling 12-month correlation of US stocks and bonds has \nbeen positive for over 600 consecutive days  — the longest streak since 1992-1995, the last time \nthe Federal Reserve sought a soft landing. \n\n600+\n\nConsecutive days \nof positive rolling \n12-month correlations\n\n10\n\nStocks account for \n35% of US S&P 500 \nmarket cap\n\n66%\n\nWeighting of US equities \nin MSCI ACWI\n\nMoreover, stock contribution to balanced portfolio risk is also rising back to ‘normal’ levels. \nIf turmoil was to strike while stock volatility is rebounding, the impact on traditionally balanced \nportfolio drawdown risks could be significant. Among equities, concentration risk has risen as \nbenchmarks have become more top-heavy from a security, sector, and country perspective. \nThe 10 largest companies in the US S&P 500 now account for a record 35% of the market \ncapitalization. Meanwhile, the US weighting in the MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI) is at \nan all-time high of 66%.3\n\nThe key takeaway? Stock, sector, and geographical diversification attributes are as weak as ever \nfor core equity exposures within the traditionally balanced portfolio.\n\n    \n\n17\n\n\x0cAlternative Steps to \nImproving Durability \nand Diversification\n\nBalancing beta risks should be the first step, with other strategies added for strength. Investors \nshould evaluate public and private market exposures based on how they improve diversification, \nmodify risks, or offer opportunistic — and potentially less correlated — alpha generation.\n\nReal assets such as gold, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), commodities, \ninfrastructure, natural resources, real estate, and digital assets can help provide a potential \ninflation volatility hedge, generate additional yield, or act as a diversifier relative to broad equities \nand fixed income, either individually or as part of a multi-asset real return strategy.\n\nOn the opportunistic front, a tactical asset allocation (TAA) strategy that tilts toward favored \nasset classes to generate risk-managed benchmark-beating returns can diversify existing \n“betas” in a portfolio. In addition, hedge fund replication and derivative income strategies attempt \nto engineer asymmetric payoff structures that differ from traditional risk assets. Amid declining \nbond yields, derivative income has an added income overlay benefit.\n\nAllocations to private assets also warrant consideration. Private equity, private credit, real estate, \nand infrastructure infuse non-traditional elements to the traditional mix of assets. These asset \nclasses may offer higher returns, lower volatility, and enhanced portfolio diversification potential. \nThe investment opportunities in private markets are vast, interesting, and growing.\n\nBecause information on private market investments is not as widely available as in public \nmarkets there is potential to capitalize on more widespread market inefficiencies. Yet, as the \nsolutions and products are not publicly traded, illiquidity must also be an important consideration \nin portfolio construction, and a long-term perspective and careful selection of managers is key.\n\nThe Playbook for More \nDurable Diversification\n\nWhile portfolios take many shapes, we believe that investors should consider: \n\n1   Using modifiers (such as derivative-based strategies, private credit, or infrastructure) \n\nfor income. \n\n2   Seeking tactical or opportunistic unconstrainted strategies that can adapt rapidly to market \n\nconditions to target non-traditional premia/alpha opportunities. \n\n3   Diversifying via strategies with lesser correlations to traditional markets — i.e., more balance \n\nacross differing environments and asset classes, such as gold, multi-asset real return, \nand commodities. \n\n    \n\n18\n\n\x0cThematic \nInvesting\n\nGCC Region in \nBloom: Expanding the \nInvestment Horizon\n\nAmid rapid economic expansion, the \nattraction of the Gulf region for investors \nis increasingly less about oil and gas and \nmore about future growth.\n\nExploring Transformative \nTechnologies: En Route to \nPeak Altitude\n\nConfidence is growing that AI and \nBlockchain-related innovations \nare nearing a breakthrough to \nthe mainstream.\n\n    \n\n19\n\n\x0cThematic \nInvesting\n\nGCC Region in Bloom: \nExpanding the \nInvestment Horizon \n\nKarine Kheirallah, \nHead of Investment Strategy \n& Research  — MEA\n\nThe Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, encompassing Saudi Arabia, the United Arab \nEmirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Oman, is undergoing a significant transformation. \nHistorically tied to energy prices, the region is now actively diversifying its economies, \nenhancing its attractiveness for domestic and international investors, and this is being reflected \nin their equity and bond markets’ performance.\n\nGCC economies are projected to grow at a rate of around 4% per annum over the next five \nyears, more than double the GDP growth rate of advanced economies.4 This growth is fueled by \nthe region’s dominance in global energy markets but also by government-led initiatives aimed \nat diversifying local economies away from oil and gas. The Vision plans launched by each GCC \ncountry, with the goal of sustainable economic development, are central to this transformation.\n\nEvolving GCC \nEquity Markets\n\n4%\n\nGDP growth over next \nfive years\n\n<50%\n\nDebt-to-GDP ratio \nof three largest \nGCC countries5\n\n$1.35T\n\nOutstanding GCC bonds \n\nGCC equity markets have evolved from limited access to greater global integration. The inclusion \nof GCC countries in the MSCI Emerging Markets (EM) Index and MSCI All Country World Index \n(ACWI) is testament to this progress. While the GCC’s representation in the EM index has \nincreased considerably, the region remains underrepresented in global indices, suggesting \npotential for further growth.\n\nBy sector, financials are dominant in GCC equity markets. However, we expect this sectoral \nconcentration to shift as diversification efforts gain momentum and developments in areas \nsuch as healthcare, education, smart infrastructure, renewable energy, and technology present \ninvestors with a wider array of growth opportunities.\n\n    \n\n20\n\n\x0cHistorical Performance \nand Diversification \nBenefits \n\nGCC equities have consistently outperformed the broader emerging markets index over the past \ndecade, despite various global challenges.6 What may be surprising for some is that GCC equities \nactually exhibit a lower-than-expected correlation with oil prices — relative outperformance \nis attributed to the region’s resilience and strategic efforts to diversify its economic base and \nequity markets.\n\nA key draw for global investors is the low correlation of GCC equities with both developed and \nemerging markets, as the region’s distinct sectoral exposure differs significantly from technology-\nheavy global markets. Furthermore, lower currency risk stemming from the stability of its dollar-\npegged currencies enhances GCC’s attractiveness in a volatile global economic environment.\n\nThe Rise of GCC \nFixed Income \n\nThe GCC’s economic diversification plans have driven substantial fixed income issuance to \nfund growth. Indeed, the total amount of outstanding bonds issued by GCC countries has more \nthan tripled since 2019, reaching nearly US$1.35 trillion by September 2024.7 Of particular \nnote has been the surge in local currency bond issuance, indicating a deepening of local bond \nmarkets. There has also been a notable rise in Sukuk and green bond issues, reflecting the GCC’s \ncommitment to diversifying the economy and promoting sustainable development.\n\nA key attraction for investors is the outperformance of GCC bonds versus the broader \nJP Morgan EMBI Global Diversified Index over the long term. They have also exhibited lower \nvolatility and drawdowns compared to their emerging market counterparts.8\n\nVision Plans \nand Thematic \nOpportunities\n\nThe Vision plans are key drivers of the GCC’s transformation. These plans encompass a wide \nrange of objectives, including developing non-oil sectors, promoting private sector investment, \nand enhancing social and environmental sustainability.\n\nInitial public offerings (IPOs) are playing a crucial role in the diversification efforts, providing \nopportunities for investors to participate in the growth of new sectors. We expect that the \ndevelopment of exchange-traded funds focused on GCC equities and bonds will further enhance \ninvestor access and liquidity.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nLooking forward, the GCC region offers growth potential, diversification benefits, and evolving \nsector dynamics. Challenges such as liquidity constraints and a volatile geopolitical landscape \nshould be noted but the GCC’s ongoing transformation and integration into the global financial \nsystem make it an investment destination worth considering for any well-diversified portfolio. \n\n    \n\n21\n\n\x0cThematic \nInvesting\n\nExploring Transformative \nTechnologies: En Route to \nPeak Altitude \n\nJennifer Bender, Ph.D.\nChief Investment Strategist\n\nInvestors are increasingly abuzz around transformative technologies with the potential to \ndisrupt the future of production and the nature of work. We believe two — Artificial Intelligence \n(AI) and Blockchain-related innovations — have passed a critical stage of discovery.\n\nArtificial Intelligence  Large-language-model-based AI applications like ChatGPT and other \ngenerative AI tools have changed the nature of the game by providing a way for corporations \nand individuals to tap into AI with minimal investment. That almost half of S&P 500 companies \nmentioned AI in their most recent earnings transcripts illustrates just how importantly this is \nviewed by businesses.\n\nArguably, the greatest promise of AI lies in the potential to improve productivity across the entire \neconomy, complementing human insights and labor as “co-pilots”. If previous experiences are \nanything to go by, the productivity gains and growth implications could be significant. That said, \npatience is warranted as, in the past, it has typically taken over a decade for benefits from the \nemergence of transformative technologies to be fully realized.\n\nWithin AI, we are seeing investors transition beyond hyper-scalers and semiconductors into \ninfrastructure, as well as sector-specific applications. Our active equity analysts are identifying \nearly movers in AI across industries, while our quantitative teams are incorporating AI to identify \nalpha signals and measure risk.\n\nBlockchain  In a similar fashion to the AI experience, blockchain-based applications have \nexpanded beyond cryptocurrencies into areas which early enthusiasts of distributed ledger \ntechnology (DLT) envisioned. The ability to “tokenize” assets has many potential benefits, not \nleast of which is lower barriers to hard-to-access assets. But even bonds (and money market \nfunds) and commodities can potentially benefit from the power of fractional ownership. One of \nour recent papers explores asset tokenization in greater detail.\n\n37%\n\n$15.2B\n\n24/7\n\nOf survey respondents in \n2024 have live DLT and \ndigital asset projects9 \n\nDigital asset issuance \nin bond markets  \n(as of 12/31/2023)\n\nOn-chain digital assets \ncan settle instantaneously \n24 hours a day\n\n    \n\n22\n\n\x0cAs investments, we are more optimistic on the promises of digitization for traditional asset \nclasses, but there is potential for fully digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible \ntokens (NFTs) to surprise us. These are still speculative assets in our opinion; but if sufficient \nnumbers of investors come to see them as a store of value, they could take on a similar role in \nportfolios as gold, whose practical uses are far less important to investors today than in the past.\n\nImplications for \nInvestors\n\nAs investors, we believe it’s helpful to think about the implications of AI, DLT, and other \ntransformative technologies across three categories:\n\n1  The macro implications — for example, how a technology might impact economic drivers \n\nsuch as inflation, GDP growth, etc.\n\n2  The implications for investors who allocate capital, including asset managers and asset owners.\n\n3  The implications for financial services more broadly.\n\nNot surprisingly, our focus at State Street Global Advisors has been on number 2, though the \nothers also impact investors, albeit in less directly visible ways at present.\n\nOne big unknown remains regulation. Governments around the world have been slow to determine how \nand what to regulate on this sphere, unsurprising given how quickly these technologies have evolved. \nRegulation will have a first order impact on their adoption and the eventual gains we are likely to see.\n\n    \n\n23\n\n\x0cContributors\n\nMichael W Arone, CFA\nChief Investment Strategist\n\nMarcel Benjamin, CFA \nFixed Income Strategist\n\nRebecca Chesworth \nSenior Equity Strategist\n\nSusan M.

Larger companies tend to \nbe less volatile than companies with smaller \nmarket capitalizations. In exchange for this \npotentially lower risk, the value of the security \nmay not rise as much as companies with \nsmaller market capitalizations. \n\nInvestments in small-sized companies may \ninvolve greater risks than in those of larger, \nbetter known companies. \n\nCommodities investing entail significant risk as \ncommodity prices can be extremely volatile due \nto wide range of factors. A few such factors \ninclude overall market movements, real or \nperceived inflationary trends, commodity index \nvolatility, international, economic and political \nchanges, change in interest and currency \nexchange rates. \n\nInvesting in REITs involves certain distinct risks \nin addition to those risks associated with \ninvesting in the real estate industry in general. \n\nEquity REITs may be affected by changes in the \nvalue of the underlying property owned by the \nREITs, while mortgage REITs may be affected by \nthe quality of credit extended. REITs are subject \nto heavy cash flow dependency, default by \nborrowers and self-liquidation. REITs, especially \nmortgage REITs, are also subject to interest rate \nrisk (i.e., as interest rates rise, the value of the \nREIT may decline). \n\nAsset Allocation is a method of diversification \nwhich positions assets among major investment \ncategories. Asset Allocation may be used in an \neffort to manage risk and enhance returns. It \ndoes not, however, guarantee a profit or protect \nagainst loss. \n\nBonds generally present less short-term risk and \nvolatility than stocks, but contain interest rate risk \n(as interest rates raise, bond prices usually fall); \nissuer default risk; issuer credit risk; liquidity risk; \nand inflation risk. These effects are usually \npronounced for longer-term securities. Any fixed \nincome security sold or redeemed prior to maturity \nmay be subject to a substantial gain or loss. \n\nInvesting in high yield fixed income securities, \notherwise known as “junk bonds”, is considered \nspeculative and involves greater risk of loss \nof\xa0principal and interest than investing in \ninvestment grade fixed income securities. \nThese lower-quality debt securities involve \ngreater risk of default or price changes due to \npotential changes in the credit quality of \nthe\xa0issuer. \n\nThere are risks associated with investing in Real \nAssets and the Real Assets sector, including \nreal estate, precious metals and natural \nresources. Investments can be significantly \naffected by events relating to these industries. \n\nHedge funds are typically unregulated private \ninvestment pools made available to only \nsophisticated investors who are able to bear the \nrisk of the loss of their entire investment. An \ninvestment in a hedge fund should be viewed as \nilliquid and interests in hedge funds are \ngenerally not readily marketable and are \ngenerally not transferable. \n\nInvestors should be prepared to bear the \nfinancial risks of an investment in a hedge fund \nfor an indefinite period of time. An investment \nin\xa0a hedge fund is not intended to be a complete \ninvestment program, but rather is intended for \ninvestment as part of a diversified \ninvestment\xa0portfolio. \n\nInvesting in foreign domiciled securities may \ninvolve risk of capital loss from unfavorable \nfluctuation in currency values, withholding \ntaxes, from differences in generally accepted \naccounting principles or from economic or \npolitical instability in other nations. Investments \nin emerging or developing markets may be more \nvolatile and less liquid than investing in \ndeveloped markets and may involve exposure \nto economic structures that are generally less \ndiverse and mature and to political systems \nwhich have less stability than those of more \ndeveloped countries. \n\n© 2025 State Street Corporation. \nAll Rights Reserved. \nID2611300-7365307.1.2.GBL.RTL  0225  \nExp.

With the global pandemic continuing, we enter 2021 with a mildly positive outlook for the upcoming recovery, but with the assumption that the path to pre-crisis growth levels will be long and uncertain. Against this backdrop, investors should be ready to play rotations in their portfolios, favouring cyclical themes but also keeping  a strong focus on quality.\x0cINVESTMENT OUTLOOK 2021\nMarket rotations in an uneven recovery \n\nCIO letter\n\nPascal BLANQUÉ \nGroup Chief  \nInvestment Officer\n\nVincent MORTIER \nDeputy Group Chief \nInvestment Officer\n\n3  For professional investors only \n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic drove an unprecedented collapse in economic activity in H1, which was followed by a desynchronised rebound. The recovery \nphase has been uneven, with the virus cycle dictating the sequence of it. We believe that the damage to the global economy will last well beyond 2021. \nOutput and personal income losses, the rise of inequality and the disruption in some sectors will be the legacies of the pandemic. Expecting that a \nvaccine will cause these to dissipate within a few months is too optimistic. \n\nExpectations of additional fiscal and monetary measures will continue to mount in the coming months amid possible virus relapses. This will drive \nsentiment in financial markets, in line with the ‘bad news for the economy, good news for the markets’ narrative that saved the day for investors in \nthe dramatic year of 2020. The performances of risk assets rebounded strongly amid the policy support. However, investors in a traditional balanced \nportfolio experienced a doubling of volatility compared with the previous decade, a nasty drying up of market liquidity and an increased correlation \namong risk assets. These features will affect portfolio construction in 2021 and beyond. \n\nWe see five investment themes to play in 2021 at portfolio level.\nFrom a cross-asset perspective, a rotation from credit (HY) into equities. Equities will likely have a better risk-return profile than high yield in a \nphase of mild recovery and earnings re-acceleration in 2021. Investors should add exposure to cyclicals stocks, quality value and post-Covid-19 ESG \nthemes. We believe old-fashioned geographical diversification will come back into focus, thanks to global trade no longer driving global growth, the \nrepatriation of value chains and the desynchronisation of cycles. At the same time, sector discrimination will become even more evident, providing \nadditional diversification opportunities.\n\nMove from fixed income to smart income. With the amount of negative yielding debt close to historical highs and interest rates expected to remain \nlow in the short term, investors should build an income engine by searching for opportunities across the board, including emerging market bonds, \nprivate debt, loans, real assets (infrastructure, real estate) and high-income equities. Opportunities in credit markets remain, but the big theme for \n2021 is what we call ‘the great discrimination’. What is sound and expensive will become even more expensive. Some areas of the market will likely \ndeteriorate further, as the abundant liquidity injected by central banks is hiding weakening fundamentals. Selection will be key in 2021.\n\nConsider govies for liquidity. Investors should consider allocating a portion of their portfolio to core government bonds, regardless of their valuations, \nprimarily for liquidity reasons in case there are phases of liquidity shortages.\n\nPlay the recovery through emerging markets assets.  In  a  still  highly  uncertain  virus  and  economic  cycle,  the  Chinese  and  Asian  economies  are \nemerging as the most resilient, having been able to effectively manage their outbreaks. So far, China has been the only country to recover to its pre-\ncrisis GDP level. The outlook of EM countries in LatAm should also improve through 2021 as the virus cycle is improving in this area. These trends \nshould support EM regional themes and EM bonds in local currency.\n\nInclude ‘true’ diversifiers. In a world of high correlation among risk assets, adding uncorrelated sources of returns may help balance the allocation. \nAbsolute  returns  approaches,  volatility,  hedging  strategies  and  gold  may  help  improve  overall  portfolio  diversification,  as  well  as  real  assets, \nprivate markets and insurance-linked securities. Those asset classes show a lower correlation to traditional asset classes, and some, like real estate \nand infrastructure, can provide an hedge against inflation.\n\nIn the medium term, the main risk for investors will be the de-anchoring of real rates and inflation expectations due to the massive fiscal stimulus, \nthe monetisation of public deficits, the rebalancing of social and political support in favour of labour and the retreat of global trade. Markets are not \npricing in this risk yet, but investors should start looking at strategies for a possible inflation comeback.\n\n\x0cINVESTMENT OUTLOOK 2021\nMarket rotations in an uneven recovery \n\nGlobal CIOs investment themes\n\nected t o   r e b ound\n\np\nx\nS e\nP\nE\n\nCyclical recovery…\n\n… and high volatility and high correlation among risk assets\n\n2019 \n\n2020 \n\n2021\n\n  2000  2002  2004  2006 \n\n2008  2010  2012  2014  2016  2018  2020\n\n  USA\u2003   Euro Area\u2003   Japan\u2003   EM\n\nLow rates, with a continuous search for income\n\nBack to record level\n\n  0.9\n\n  0.6\n\n  0.3\n\n \n\n0\n\n \n\n \n\ns\ne\ns\ns\na\nl\nc\n \nt\ne\ns\ns\na\nk\ns\ni\nr\n \n6\ng\nn\no\nm\na\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nl\ne\nr\nr\no\nC\n\n \n\nS\nA\nE\nD\n\nI\n \n\nO\nI\nL\nF\nO\nT\nR\nO\nP\n \n1\n2\n0\n2\n\n1.

This process will drive increasing inequalities and lasting \nsectoral divergences, and will come with monetisation of debt that could eventually push inflation higher, though this is highly unlikely in 2021.\n\nWe  are  approaching  2021  with  Covid-19  still  propagating  and  caseloads  rising. \nWhile  advances  in  testing  and  treatments  continue,  we  do  not  expect  the  rapid \ndevelopment  or  wide  distribution  of  a  safe  and  effective  vaccine  before  H2  2021. \nCovid-19 developments will continue to be the central theme feeding into our 2021 \ninvestment narratives. \nThe outlook remains uncertain and unstable. The duration of the epidemic (which is \nan  exogenous  variable)  will  ultimately  determine  the  form  of  the  recovery,  and  we \nbelieve  the  use  and  abuse  of  the  alphabet  letters  could  be  misleading  at  this  point. \nThis will leave the door wide open to an erratic growth profile in the short term and \nultimately would tend to confirm our central scenario of a slow, uneven and multi-\nspeed recovery, depending on the country and sector. \n\nTo pencil in our forecasts we rely on specific, reasonable yet conservative assumptions \namid factors that are inherently difficult to predict. Against a backdrop of fundamental \nuncertainty related to the pandemic, we are conscious that the key step forward will \nbe to transition from monetary to fiscal dominance which, unlike in the 60s/70s, is \nunlikely to create inflation in 2021. In fact, central banks worldwide are equipped and \nsufficiently autonomous to avoid inflation rushes in the short term, while supporting \ngovernments to deliver the required support for the current crisis by providing liquidity \nto allow buffers to absorb prospective losses and ease financial conditions.\nMoreover, this support underlines an important change in the orthodoxy: we will see \ngovernments  switching  towards  more  flexible  budgetary  management,  evolving \n(if not revolutionising) their policy frameworks. We believe a multi-year process will \nbe  required  to  get  the  world  back  in  order  from  a  GDP  and  income  per  capita \nperspective.  The  recovery  will  exacerbate  existing  fragmentations,  leading  to  an \nincrease in inequalities and lasting sectoral divergences, which we are monitoring and \nwill address in the following pages. \n\nWe expect macro factors to continue to influence market dynamics: liquidity, \ngrowth, inflation, rates, debt and monetary aggregates are the key factors on \nwhich we structure next year’s investment narratives. \n\n2.5\n\n1.0\n\n-0.5\n\n-2.0\n\n-3.5\n\nLow growth, low rates, low inflation and looser monetary and fiscal policies will help \nbalance the rising debt burdens and rising income and wealth inequalities.\nAgainst  this  uncertain  backdrop,  investors  will  have  to  tactically  look  at  rotation \nopportunities. In particular, improvements in economic momentum could support a \nrotation in risk asset themes (more cyclical) through 2021. \n\nGlobal composite economic momentum (CEMI)  \nset to rebound in Q4 2020, tactically supporting risk assets\n\nIMPROVING\n\nOct 2020\n\nBOOMING\n\nJan 2020\n\nDec 2020\n\nOct 2021\n\nDec 2021\n\nJul 2021\n\nJul 2020\n\nApr 2020\n\nApr 2021\n\nWEAKNESS\n\nDETERIORATING\n\n \n\n-4.0 \n\n-2.5 \n\n-1.0 \n\n0.5 \n\n2.0 \n\n3.5\n\n  2020\u2003   2021\n\nThe  Global  Composite  Economic  Momentum  index  is  an  Amundi  proprietary  indicator  based  on  four  regional  baskets  (US,  Eurozone,  \nJapan and EM) and on the following variables: earnings revisions, 10y interest rates, leading indicators, CPI YoY, PMI surveys, the Economic \nSurprise Index and the Inflation Surprise Index.

We  expect \nglobal trade to remain weak and uneven: the regions \nand countries more dependent on highly impacted \nsectors (i.e., tourism, leisure, travel) are particularly \nvulnerable. We expect more decorrelated business \ncycles  across  countries  and  areas  than  in  the  past \nand this implies there will be more opportunities for \ndiversification  amid  increased  fragmentations  and \ndivergences at country and sector level.\n\nThe timing and extension of the pandemic, outbreaks \nand targeted lockdowns will set the economic paths \nand  further  increase  divergences.

We expect central banks to continue \nfine-tuning  their  accommodation,  providing  credit \nprovisions  to  a  wide  range  of  borrowers  and \nsimultaneously  supporting  sentiment.  This  multi-\nyear global effort will end with larger debt levels. \nDebt  composition,  quantity  and  repayment  will \nopen  up  an  arduous  debate  on  taxation  to  avoid \nfinancial repression, hyperinflation and defaults. It is \nunlikely debt will constitute the highest vulnerability \nfor 2021, but we believe we have to consider it.\n\nSource: Amundi Research, as of 10 November 2020.\n\n7  For professional investors only \n\n\x0cA more balanced globalisation may offer new investment opportunities\n\nThe Covid-19 crisis may have been the catalyst for a third wave of globalisation, where economic actors, more aware of the vulnerability of the current system, shift their \nbehaviour in search of resilience. This may generate lower trade growth, the reallocation of trade flows and more decorrelated business cycles.\n\nGlobal themes\n\nA third globalisation phase has started\nFrom a historical perspective, so far there have been two waves of globalisation, \nand we may have entered into a third wave with the Covid-19 crisis. The first wave \nstarted in the 19th century, and came to an end with the beginning of WWI. Until 1870, \nworldwide exports accounted for less than 10% of global output. Today, the value of \nexported goods is close to 25% at global level. This means that over the intervening \nperiod,  trade  increased  faster  than  GDP  growth.  The  second  wave  started  after \nWWII. It was enabled by technology and in particular by the reduction in transaction \ncosts, which in turn had an impact not only on the volumes of trade, but also on the \ntypes  of  exchanges  that  were  possible.  Since  the  1990s,  economic  integration  has \nstrengthened due to global value chains (where the different stages of the production \nprocess  are  located  across  different  countries/areas)  and  today  about  30%  of  the \nvalue of global exports comes from foreign inputs (in 1990 the share was about 25%). \nGlobal trade peaked in 2010–2012 after two decades of continuous increases. But this \nmarked  the  end  of  the  “great  globalisation”,  during  which  world  trade  grew  twice \nas fast as global GDP. After the Great Financial Crisis (GFC), there was a slowdown \nin  global  trade:  from  the  GFC  until  the  Covid-19  crisis,  global  trade  has  been  more \naligned with global GDP.\n\nAverage GDP growth and world trade growth since the 1980s\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n \n\nh\nt\nw\no\nr\ng\ny\nl\nr\na\ne\ny\n%\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1990-95  1995-2000  2000-05 \n\n2005-10 \n\n2010-15  2015-20  2020-22\n\n World trade, 5y average, annual growth\u2003  World GDP growth 5y average\n World trade-to-world GDP growth rates, ratio\n\nSource: Amundi Research CPB, Datastream, Bloomberg, as of 10 November 2020.\n\n8  For professional investors only \n\nUnbridled globalisation ends, sustainable globalisation may begin\nToday trade is a fundamental part of economic activity everywhere and it is difficult \nto envision it will end abruptly. In today’s global economic system, countries exchange \nnot  only  final  products,  but  also  intermediate  inputs,  creating  an  intricate  network \nof  economic  interactions  at  a  global  level  as  production  processes  have  become \nintertwined: the production chains for good and services have become increasingly \ncomplex and global. There is no willingness to backtrack from the achievements of \nglobalisation  (trade  generates  efficiency  gains,  and  via  competition/economies  of \nscale/learning and innovation processes creates a virtuous circle of growth, with trade \nliberalisation leading also to productivity gains). Yet new impetuses are building as \nthe crisis has exposed underestimated vulnerabilities, leading economic actors to \nbecome more resilient. Governments may embrace the concepts of economic and \nstrategic sovereignty, as well as health sovereignty, while companies have become \nmore aware they need to carefully evaluate their vulnerability to a range of shocks \n(geographical  risks,  cybersecurity  risks,  trade  disputes  and  long  and  somewhat \nuncontrollable  value  chains).  Consumers,  especially  the  younger  generation,  are \nshifting their preferences towards more transparent, fair and green local products. \nLooking at the medium term, the redesign of production chains could see trade flows \nshifting from their current patterns. To give an idea of the sizes involved, a McKinsey \nstudy found that 16-26% of world trade could, over time, shift to different countries, \nworth the equivalent of $2.9-4.6tr in exports each year.\n\nEconomic and investment implications\nThere was a “common factor” that boosted world growth (the unbridled growth of \ntrade) that is likely to fade away and in future a relatively larger share of the economic \ncycle  should  come  from  domestic  demand.  In  addition,  both  the  fundamentals  of \nprivate consumption and the fundamentals of business investment vary greatly from \ncountry to country. Looking ahead, this means that business cycles will tend to be \nmore decorrelated across countries and areas than in the past. In terms of portfolio \nconstruction,  more  decorrelated  cycles  mean  more  opportunities  for  portfolio \ndiversification through selection.\n\n2021 INVESTMENT OUTLOOK\x0cMacro divergences reverberate on sector allocation\n\nGrowth divergences will continue, with on-off periods dictated by outbreaks and targeted lockdowns. Sector divergences have style and regional investment implications.\n\nGlobal themes\n\nMSCI ACWI price return YTD base 100 (12 November 2020)\n\nGrowth lacklustre and uneven until a large-scale vaccination arrives\nThe global synchronised rebound, with small divergences due to the timing of crisis entry \nand  the  extension  of  the  pandemic,  has  led  to  increasingly  diverging  growth  dynamics \nat  country  level,  dictated  by  on-off  periods  (outbreaks  and  targeted  lockdowns).  The \nstrongest divergence is represented by China vs. the rest of the world, with China better \nmanaging  any  coming  second  wave  and  recovering  faster  to  pre-crisis  levels.  In  Europe, \nmost of the vulnerability is concentrated in peripheral countries, with a higher proportion of \nthe gross value added in sectors most affected by the lockdowns and curfews (hospitality, \nleisure, travel, tourism). Only a large-scale vaccination (from mid-2021) can synchronise the \nuneven economic paths, drive a pick-up in mobility and help the services sector rebound. \nThe  2021  economic  recovery  is  expected  to  be  mediocre  versus  recent  history,  with \nimportant output losses. 2021 will be a transition year towards a post-pandemic economy: \nhigh contact sectors will shrink in favour of digitalisation and there will be a massive effort \nto retrain workers. \nA benign inflation trajectory is under way, with only a gradual pickup in 2021 vs. 2020 due \nto  the  slack  in  the  economy.  Developed  markets  (DM)  Inflation  will  see  only  temporary \novershoots  in  the  US,  while  in  Europe  inflation  will  remain  below  target.  Non-core \ncomponents,  such  as  food  prices,  will  drive  up  emerging  markets  (EM)  inflation  due  to \nsupply disruptions and food export restrictions related to the pandemic.\n\n  160\n\n  140\n\n  120\n\n  100\n\n  80\n\n  60\n\n  40\n\n \n\nFinding the right policy mix: nature and timing\nKeeping a very accommodative policy mix is paramount. On the monetary policy front, \nthe focus on unconventional measures is firm in DM. EM CBs will mostly use the more \nconventional of the unconventional tools to manage and enhance liquidity. On the fiscal \nside, in the US and in Europe we expect to see a boost in growth coming from the fiscal \npackages, but on the other hand are accounting for milder multipliers due to the social \ndistancing rules in place. China’s fiscal policy will turn less expansionary in comparison \nto 2020, providing less support for infrastructure investments. Overall, debt levels will \nremain  at  record  highs  next  year  and  the  return  to  a  more  sustainable  path  will  be \ndelayed  at  best,  particularly  in  countries  with  subdued  growth  dynamics  and  higher \nborrowing costs.\n\n9  For professional investors only \n\n01-20  02-20  03-20  04-20  05-20  06-20  07-20  08-20  09-20  10-20  11-20\n Retailing\u2003  Tech HW\u2003  Software\u2003  Semis\u2003  Media\u2003  MSCI ACWI \n Telcos \u2003  Real Estate\u2003  Insurance\u2003  Banks\u2003  Energy\n\nSource: Amundi Research Datastream, as of 12 November 2020.\n\nSector divergences with style and regional implications\nThe collapse of Q2 2020 results will probably mark the low point of the cycle. At this point, \nstrong  sectoral  divergences  were  noted,  both  in  term  of  results  and  performances.  Only \ntwo sectors managed to report positive earnings growth, namely healthcare and IT. These \nsectors  are  overweighted  in  growth-style  indices,  and  also  within  country  and  regional \nindices such as the S&P 500 and the MSCI Emerging Asia. Their divergence with lagging \nsectors, including those most affected by the pandemic (transport, leisure, automobile, etc.) \nand energy (also neglected given its non-SRI status) is extreme. In 2021, a rebound in the \nmost  impacted  sectors  is  expected.  This  should  therefore  see  the  performance  of  style \nand  regional  indices  move  in  the  opposite  direction. Within  DM,  European  and  Japanese \nmarkets are expected to benefit, at least temporarily, as are LatAm and EMEA within EM. It \nwill then be necessary to sort out the short- and long-term winners. And in this game, Asia \nand the United States may not have had their last word.\n\n2021 INVESTMENT OUTLOOK\x0cPolitical, fiscal and monetary trilogy seek the ‘triplete’\n\nThe reaction to the Covid-19 crisis will be dominated by the leading and connected roles of fiscal policy and political actors. Monetary policy will adapt not only to funding \nneeds, but also to the time needed for fiscal policy to deploy its support. QE expansion and extension will be a key factor for financial markets and valuations.\n\nGlobal themes\n\nExecution from political to fiscal dominance is still a key challenge \n2020 will be remembered as the year of record growth in global public debt, driven \nby the unprecedented fiscal response needed to counteract the Covid-19-related crisis. \nHowever, the bar to prevent further amplification of the shock not only remains high, \nbut has moved even higher as the pandemic’s second wave poses additional risks to an \nalready slow and uneven recovery. Furthermore, great expectations built in the US and \nthe Eurozone during the summer, for a Fiscal 4 package in the US and a joint project \nin  the  EU.  But  after  summer,  progress  on  both  fronts  has  slowed.  As  the  economy \nrecovered, the appetite for a massive and bipartisan pre-election deal decreased, while \non the EU front, there has been friction among states on several points of the agreement. \nLooking at next year, in the US we expect only a small package to be delivers and it \nmay be more likely to play a role in the first part of 2021, while in the NGEU, except for \nsome upfront payments, we foresee the bulk of the funding being disbursed from 2022 \nonwards.  Although  some  instruments,  such  as  the  SURE,  could  help  public  finances \nin the near term, on the European front the fiscal support to economic actors will still \nplay out mainly via national plans in the meantime, with the risk of countries with less \nfiscal  space  and  greater  vulnerability  to  economic  shocks  being  left  behind.  On  the \nother hand, the acceleration of the second pandemic wave may lead European political \nauthorities to make more effort to promptly and effectively start the NGEU programme. \n\nThe supremacy of fiscal policy and the supporting role of \nmonetary policy\nOur  guess  is  that  this  strenuous  fiscal  global  match  will  last  many  years  and  will \nconclude with larger debt levels. Its composition, quantity and repayment will open up \nan arduous debate on taxation to avoid financial repression, hyperinflation and defaults. \nIt is unlikely debt will constitute the highest vulnerability for 2021, but we believe we \nhave  to  consider  it.  Next  year  we  expect  central  banks  to  continue  fine-tuning  their \naccommodation  beyond  sheer  scale  to  also  assist  and  cheer  fiscal  spending  (and \nimpressive debt accumulation), both in terms of volumes and timing, allowing credit \nprovisions to a wide range of borrowers and simultaneously supporting sentiment.\n\nP\nD\nG\n \nf\no\n%\n\n \n\n  140\n\n  120\n\n  100\n\n  80\n\n  60\n\n  40\n\n  20\n\n0\n\n \n\n \n\nNGEU = Next Generation EU. PE = price to earnings. EPS= earnings per share.\n\n10  For professional investors only \n\nMonetary policy remains key for financial markets and valuation\nInterest rate control from central banks, which prevents any spikes in the long-term part \nof the curve, has several implications from a cross-asset perspective as well as in the \nfixed income space. For instance, low rates will provide equity risk premia support for \nequities despite the 11-year bull market and the recent recession. In addition, PE adjusted \nfor central banks’ balance sheet expansion suggests a potential upside close to double \ndigits. Moreover, low rates preserve the benign environment for margins and EPS.

A steepening of the yield curve and a weaker USD should help the more \ncyclical/value markets to rebound first, but the US, which is rich in disruptive stocks, is a winner due to its low rates, which will be the other part of the equation in 2021.\n\n=/+\n\nIn 2020, the EU recovery fund made Europe investable again. In 2021, the strong relationship between EMU and MSCI World in bond yields should eventually help the \nregion to benefit tactically from a steepening of the yield curve. The more defensive UK, also a proxy for energy (ESG unfriendly) vs. industrials (among the winners of  \nthe next cycle) will likely still lag.\n\nJapan is one of the most cyclical markets, with the biggest weighting in industrials (20%), a winner of the coming cycle, and consumer discretionary (18%) the second \nbiggest. As such, Japan is a candidate to benefit from the recovery. The biggest headwind would be a strong rebound of the JPY, which we do not expect if global risks \neventually fade next year.\n\nEM are an interesting combination of secular technology-related sector plays (IT, consumer discretionary and communication services), mostly in North Asia, and more \ntraditional cyclicals (financials and materials), especially in LatAm and EMEA. Asia has been strong in 2020. A USD breakdown would be a catalyst for a broader EM \noutperformance.\n\nAs the recovery progresses, the medium-term trend will be for the curve to continue to gradually steepen on the very long part. The extent of the steepening will be \ncontingent on the evolution of the virus and on the fiscal stimulus put in place after the elections.\xa0The inflation premium at the long end of the US curve should continue \nto rise moderately.\n\nWe maintain a constructive view on US IG on the back of: (1) central bank support; and (2) the search for yield. The curve steepened with Fed buying and the sweet spot \nis in 7-10y.\n\nWe expect  to see increasing fragmentation in US HY on two fronts: (1) companies that maintain high cash levels for any contingency vs. those that burn cash to sustain \nthemselves; (2) the increasing gap between sectors (tourism, energy) that experienced heavy falls in revenues vs. those that witnessed higher sales (technology). For investors, \nthis means idiosyncratic and default risks are not correctly priced in and spread compression will not be uniform. As a result, attention to selection and quality is paramount.\n\nOn the back of unattractive valuations and with an expected stable outlook for yields, we maintain a cautious view on core government bonds. However, on peripheral debt, \nwe remain positive amid strong ECB support, to be strengthened further in 2021 through additional purchases and coming EU support, starting with the SURE programme.\n\nDespite most of the spread tightening having been delivered, IG and especially BBB-rated corporates are still targeted by yield searchers and look resilient thanks to \nongoing ECB QE. We continue to prefer EUR over US, due to the lower leverage in the latter, and play this through financial and subordinated debt that offers the \npotential for extra yield.\n\nAmong European HY we recommend the higher quality segment (BBs in particular), in order to combine the need to reduce volatility and to profit from remaining carry. EUR HY \ncontinues to be more resilient to default risk than US HY, thanks to its higher credit quality and sectoral exposure. However, the need for selection and cash buffers remains high.\n\nEM bonds HC\n\n=/+\n\nWhile the spread tightening potential in EM bonds is limited for 2021 given what has already occurred in 2020, we believe the asset class could still benefit from inflows \nfrom investors in search of carry in a world of low rates. Among EM asset classes, HC debt would be the most resilient in case of a deterioration of the outlook. \n\nIn a scenario of economic recovery, the low yields in DM and the weak dollar are supportive for EM debt in local currencies and the FX component should benefit in 2021. \nHowever, selection will be relevant as some countries are still vulnerable in the current uncertain environment.\n\nIn 2021 commodities will be supported by the recovery in the economic cycle and by the still favourable financial conditions. WTI oil should stay in the $40-50 range in H1 \n2021, while base metals should also recover. Gold will also benefit from easing central banks and is favoured in the case of continuing uncertainty.\n\nA shift from a contraction phase to a recovery will likely put the USD under pressure. A broad USD move lower is expected, but considering the higher policy flexibility \nand the direct link to China, we believe commodities-related currencies will be the relative winners in G10. On EM FX, volatility will remain throughout 2021, but some \nappreciation is on the cards.\n\n---   --   -      =     +  ++  +++\nNegative View       Neutral         Positive View\n\nSource: Amundi, as of 12 November 2020.

Investors should \nsearch for yield across the credit spectrum, favour inflation-linked bonds to govies, cyclical sectors and, selectively, EM assets.\n\nInvestment convictions\n\nHow to navigate the fragile recovery environment\nThe second wave of the contagion is materialising and brings many risks to economic \nactivities and uncertainties on many fronts, however a recovery scenario remains our \ncentral  one.  According  to  our  macroeconomic  projections,  the  profits  rebound \nshould be robust at about 30%, though this is lower compared to the consensus of \n40% due to the fat tail risks (the probability of correction and contraction phases in \nour proprietary tool, the Advance Investment Phazer, is 20%). Nevertheless, current \nprofits expectations should be enough for a cross-asset risk rerating throughout \n2021,  focusing  on  growth-related  asset  classes  such  as  equities,  HY  and  GEM \nbonds. The anaemic strength of the recovery would suggest, however, that investors \nshould not play the highest beta markets too much but rather maintain a focus on \nquality and more defensive themes. For this reason, in DM we favour the equity space \nand in GEM we favour bonds. In a low-yield world, we prefer IG credit to govies for \nrisk-adjusted carry reasons. Exposure to inflation linkers could help to mitigate any \nnegative impact on the duration front, should rates move higher in case of inflation \nspikes in the upside scenario. On the commodity front, base metals are typically the \nbest performers, while at this time gold should also be considered as a way to hedge \ncross-asset allocations given the significant probability of the downside risk scenario \nand the ultra-dovish central banks.\n\nHow to play the growth theme in an unprecedented recovery\nThe severe recession induced by the pandemic has led to an unprecedented situation \nin which HY spreads  are  artificially  close  to  their  historical  lows.  Historically, during \nrecessions  DM  HY  spreads  have  been  about  1,000  bps,  so  the  current  dislocation \neffect  due  to  CB  interventions  is  massive.  For  this  reason,  it’s  unlikely  during  this \ncrisis that HY will outperform equities in the central or upside risk scenarios.\nAccording  to  our  fair  value  calculations,  the  expected  returns  distributions  are \nsignificantly skewed to the downside due to the painful combination of fat tail risks, \nanaemic  growth  and  expensive  valuations  due  to  CB  interventions.  However,  the \nupside  is  definitely  capped  for  HY  due  to  limited  spread  tightening,  while  equities \nhave much more space to overperform, should profits surprise on the upside.\n\ny\nt\ni\nl\ni\n\nb\na\nb\no\nr\nP\n\n  70%\n\n  60%\n\n  50%\n\n  40%\n\n  30%\n\n  20%\n\n  10%\n\n0\n\n \n\n \n\n13  For professional investors only \n\nProfits and fiscal stimulus implementation\nOne of the (few) risks to the upside is the full speed implementation of fiscal stimulus \nplans in the US (and Europe), which would boost our profits growth expectations by \n10%-15%. In this scenario equities would be even more preferable. \nOn the downside, the corporate sector’s vulnerability remains the key risk to monitor. In \nsuch an unpleasant scenario, equities would suffer more than HY as CBs have proved \nto be more successful in controlling debt markets and therefore de-risking would likely \noccur via equities selling.\n\nAccording to our fair value calculations, equities have more upside than HY \nshould the recovery surprise on the upside.\n\nIn the downside risk \nscenario, equities would \nsuffer more than HY\n\nUnder the base and upside \nscenarios, equities have much \nmore potential than HY\n\n]\n%\n0\n4\n-\n \n<\n[\n\n]\n%\n0\n3\n-\n \n;\n%\n0\n4\n-\n[\n\n]\n%\n0\n2\n-\n \n;\n%\n0\n3\n-\n[\n\n]\n%\n0\n1\n-\n \n;\n%\n0\n2\n-\n[\n\n S&P500\u2003  US HY\n\n]\n%\n0\n \n;\n%\n0\n1\n-\n[\n\n]\n%\n0\n1\n \n;\n%\n0\n[\n\n]\n \n%\n0\n2\n \n;\n%\n0\n1\n[\n\n]\n%\n0\n3\n \n;\n%\n0\n2\n[\n\n]\n%\n0\n4\n \n;\n%\n0\n3\n[\n\n]\n%\n0\n4\n \n>\n[\n\nThe fair value calculation tool is an Amundi proprietary model that generates N- simulations according to our internal macro-financial \nforecasts and official probabilities of the economic financial regimes from the Advanced Investment Phazer.

These factors \nsuggest investors should consider pro-cyclical positioning, while still favouring quality. The resulting regional allocation is quite diversified.\n\nInvestment convictions\n\nStill a wall of worries to climb, but a bottoming out of the cycle is \nunder way\n2020 was an extraordinary year. The manufacturing recovery, which began to take shape \nat the start of the year, turned into a sharp recession. Profits bottomed out in Q2. The strong \ncut in rates, the depressed oil price, and in the US, the weakening of the dollar, bodes well \nfor a cyclical recovery in 2021 and a proportional upturn in profits. For now, IBES forecasts \na  level  of  earnings  per  share  in  2021  that  is  broadly  equivalent  to  that  of  the  2019  peak \nyear in the United States and the Eurozone. The real extent of the recovery will depend on \nthe revival of consumer confidence, which is  linked to the containment of the virus. False \nstarts cannot be  ruled out, but the commitment of governments, combined with that of \ncentral banks, which will respond again in the event of further shocks, will eventually dispel \nconsumers’ doubts. Taking a 12-month view, cyclical stocks should ultimately benefit.\n\nThree specificities for the new cycle\n\x83\x83 The  historically  low  level  of  interest  rates:  while  absolute  equity  market  valuations \n(PER) are tight, equity risk premiums remain attractive. Equities therefore appear to be \nan essential alternative for investors (TINA). \n\n\x83\x83 Disruption: the pandemic accelerated changes already under way and created a very \nstrong divergence between “disruptive” sectors, those of long duration with superior \nearnings  growth  and  that  benefit  from  a  low  discount  rate,  and  “disrupted”  sectors, \nwith short duration. This has happened to such an extent that regional performances \nare now above all impacted by the sectoral composition of the indices. \n\n\x83\x83 The  combination  of  these  two  factors  have  strongly  benefited  some  growth  stocks, \nsuch that a bubble may be taking shape, which is unusual at the start of a cycle. In the \n1990s, the bubble in technology stocks appeared at the end of the cycle and amplified \nthe uptrend of the rest of the market, whereas they diverge today. Moreover, bubbles \nusually burst only when central banks withdraw liquidity, which is not on the agenda \nfor  many  quarters;  a  strong  exaggeration  of  high  growth  stocks  therefore  remains  a \ncredible scenario for 2021, beyond a cyclical rebound at first.\n\nIn 2021, investors should be prepared to play the recovery with a focus on quality \ncyclicals, while watching for possible areas of bubbles.\n\nPER = price-to-earnings ratio. TINA = there is no alternative (to equities, because all other investments appear less remunerative). \n\n14  For professional investors only \n\nEPS growth according to IBES\n\n  60\n\n  30\n\n \n\n0\n\n  -30\n\n  -60\n\n \n\n2018 \n\n2019 \n\n2020 \n\n2021 \n\n2022\n\n USA\u2003  Eurozone\u2003  UK\u2003  Japan\u2003  Pacific Ex Japan\n\nSource: Refinitiv, Amundi Research. Data as of 26 October 2020. \n\nDiversified positioning, but pro-cyclical with a quality bias\nOn  the  one  hand,  the  looming  economic  recovery  suggests  a  focus  on  cyclicals  versus \ndefensive stocks. On the other hand, the historically low level of interest rates could eventually \npush stocks that benefit from disruption to levels beyond reason. In both cases, the quality \nfactor should be favoured. The industrial sector is perhaps the one that best meets all of \nthese criteria. Regionally, this translates into a fairly diversified portfolio, but one with a pro-\ncyclical nature. As pro-cyclical markets, Europe ex-UK and Japan should bounce back first in \nthe recovery. However, the US could eventually take the lead again, should a bubble develop \nfurther. Although very cheap, the UK market, which is rather defensive and is a proxy for \nthe  energy/industrials  ratio,  should  underperform  the  Eurozone  again  in  2021.  The  Pacific \nex-Japan (rich in financial stocks and very much exposed to global trade) could temporarily \nbeat Japan during the first round of the recovery, but should underperform Japan (rich \nin industrial stocks) in the longer term.\n\n2021 INVESTMENT OUTLOOK\x0cFactor investing: selective preference for size, value and quality factors\n\nThe economic recovery looming in 2021 is atypical (disruption and historically low rates). It will therefore be necessary to find a compromise between pro-cyclicality and  \nlong-term winners.\n\nInvestment convictions\n\nThe current stage of the cycle suggests focusing on the size factor\nIn  early  2020,  after  a  decade-long  bullish  cycle,  we  proposed  remaining  rather \ndefensive, favouring the low volatility  factor  and  gradually  increasing pro-cyclical \nfactors, as the first signs of a manufacturing recovery were emerging. The pandemic \nultimately precipitated a recession; prudence was therefore rewarded.\nFor  2021,  we  envision  a  more  risk-on  approach.  The  unprecedented  combined \nresponse of central banks and governments to the crisis lends credibility to a scenario \nof  economic  recovery.  The  timing  and  the  pace  of  this  recovery  are  still  unknown, \nbut any economic relapse will provide arguments for strengthening monetary and/or \nfiscal stimulus further. Also, we believe that beyond possible false starts, we must be \nmindful of pro-cyclical factors.\nSmall and mid caps (Smids), which are usually more cyclical, often do well at the \nstart of a cycle. We favour this theme, especially in Europe. In the United States, \nif  there  are  also  opportunities  within  this  universe,  the  relative  performance  of  the \nSmids  indices  will  depend  above  all  on  the  more  uncertain  behaviour  of  the  mega \ncaps, which are already very expensive but benefit from disruption and very low rates. \nLow volatility factor, on the other hand, is a factor to be avoided.\n\nPrefer value and quality to growth and momentum\nThe difference in valuations between the value and growth factors has never been \nso  big,  even  during  the  internet  bubble.  At  that  time,  betting  on  a  normalisation \nseemed an obvious choice, all the more so as a slight steepening of the yield curve \non long maturities made sense in the context of an economic recovery. The current \nsituation would therefore seem supportive in principle of the value factor. \nHowever, the situation today presents a notable difference compared with the internet \nbubble. At the end of the 1990s, the growth factor had exaggerated a bullish trend \nin the market at the end of the cycle. Today, the cycle has only just started and the \ngrowth factor is already diverging from value (a phenomenon recently described as \na K recovery). The economic recovery could thus revitalise the value factor at some \npoint, but we cannot rule out that in a context where interest rates are set to remain \nlow, the growth factor will eventually amplify this rise despite its valuation. \n\n  250\n\n  200\n\n  150\n\n  100\n\n  50\n\n \n\n0\n\n15  For professional investors only \n\nThus, beyond a rebound in favour of value, prudence dictates that investors should \nhedge    against  the  possibility  of  a  more  lasting  upward  exaggeration  of  growth \n(bubble?). To do so, the quality factor, which takes the sustainability of growth into \naccount and helps avoid excessively indebted stocks at the same time, should clearly \nremain a core holding, particularly compared to the more speculative growth or \nmomentum factors. \n\nIn 2021, we intend to play the cyclical recovery through Smids (in Europe)  \nfirst and will monitor the situation with a view to selectively extending our  \npro-cyclical exposure to the value style, while also maintaining a structural bias \non quality at the global level.\n\nMSCI World growth vs. value composite premium (PE, P/BV, DY)\n\n11 Nov 2020\n\n229\n\n8\n7\n9\n1\n\n0\n8\n9\n1\n\n2\n8\n9\n1\n\n4\n8\n9\n1\n\n6\n8\n9\n1\n\n8\n8\n9\n1\n\n0\n9\n9\n1\n\n2\n9\n9\n1\n\n4\n9\n9\n1\n\n6\n9\n9\n1\n\n8\n9\n9\n1\n\n0\n0\n0\n2\n\n2\n0\n0\n2\n\n4\n0\n0\n2\n\n6\n0\n0\n2\n\n8\n0\n0\n2\n\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n2\n1\n0\n2\n\n4\n1\n0\n2\n\n6\n1\n0\n2\n\n8\n1\n0\n2\n\n0\n2\n0\n2\n\n Growth vs. value premium\u2003  Average\u2003  +1 SD\u2003  -1 SD\n\nSource: Analysis by Amundi Research, Datastream.

The search for yield in developed markets, both \nthrough spread (mainly in Europe) and duration (more in the US) is likely to remain key in 2021, offering opportunities in the lower for longer yield environment.\n\nInvestment convictions\n\nGlobal easing to continue, and to keep supporting bond markets\nCentral banks will continue to expand the size of their balance sheets next year to \nsupport fiscal policy, keeping financing costs low and covering most of the additional \nnet issuance. At the same time, ZIRP and NIRP are likely to persist for quite a long \ntime. In Europe, an extension and expansion of the current net QE purchases and of \nreinvestments would ultimately continue to support yield hunting. In the US, the Fed \nwill continue to buy at least at the current pace of $80bn treasury purchases every \nmonth until the end of 2021. The Fed can easily adapt the size and composition of \nthe purchases (increasing the maturity) in case of a disorderly sell-off in bonds or a \nweakening of the US economy. We expect central banks to continue to absorb a lot \nof governments’ extra issuance, limiting the risk of a steepening induced by excess \nsupply. The Fed wants to keep long-term bond yields moderate because of the high \nlevels of public and private debt. The Fed and Treasury will likely maintain the section \n13(3) facilities designed to support credit markets and this will serve as a backstop as \nlong as downside risks related to the pandemic remain. \n\nGovies: Look for a steeper US curve, in Eurozone favour the periphery\nA  slightly  steeper  yield  curve  in  the  United  States  would  be  consistent  with  the \neconomic recovery scenario.\xa0As the recovery progresses, the medium-term trend will \nbe  for  the  curve  to  continue  to  gradually  steepen  as  10y  and  30y  yields  will  likely \nincrease from current levels over the next year. The timing of the steepening will be \ncontingent on the evolution of the virus and the fiscal stimulus put in place after the \nelections. The rise at the very long end of the curve should be driven by both the real \nyield and the breakeven component. The inflation premium at the long end of the US \ncurve  should  continue  to  rise  moderately  and  the  big  question  now  is  whether  the \nprolonged period of combined fiscal and monetary stimulus and the move to average \ninflation targeting will succeed in changing the inflation landscape. In the Eurozone, \nour preference stays with periphery vs. core, with Italian bonds accounting for most \nof the limited positive yield left, especially in the longer segments of the yield curve, \nwhere available alternatives are more limited in private debt. \n\nThe  recovery  fund  deal,  SURE  support  and  the  ECB’s  QE  and  liquidity  injections \nstrengthened  the  demand  for  peripheral  debt,  improving  their  technicals.

EM bonds still have some space in valuation terms and will likely benefit from the search for yield. In the equity space, \nas soon as the recovery becomes more solid, we will see a rotation from growth to value. Asia is favoured in the first phase of the earnings recovery.\n\nInvestment convictions\n\nEM equity\nEquity valuations are giving different signals across the regions. Asian stock markets \nappear  expensive:  they  have  already  rallied  a  lot  since  March,  while  Latin  America \nand  EMEA  are  lagging  behind  at  well  below  pre-crisis  levels.  In  terms  of  earnings, \nthe divergence is also strong: at aggregate level MSCI EM trailing earnings (in USD) \nare  currently  at  -19%  YoY,  while  EM  Asia  is  at  -9%  and  the  picture  is  only  slightly \nnegative for China. In China, the recovery after the lockdown has been quicker and \nthe  containment  of  the  virus  much  more  effective.  Moreover,  China,  and  emerging \nAsia in general, benefited from their index compositions being more concentrated in \nthose sectors that have been able to achieve profits in these difficult times: healthcare,  \ninformation technology, communication services and retailing (part of the consumer \ndiscretionary sector and including some ecommerce stocks such as Alibaba). Looking \nto 2021, our internal forecasts are for a double-digit (+13% in USD) MSCI EM earnings \nrecovery at aggregate level, mainly driven by a strong rebound in world trade, emerging \nexports and a mild but positive increase in commodities. The profits growth in the \nfirst half of 2021 will be more concentrated in emerging Asia, which is much more \nadvanced in the recovery and also more linked to the booming ecommerce sector. \nThe  laggards,  such  as  LatAm  and  EMEA,  should  return  to  positive  YoY  numbers \nonly in the second half of 2021. In the short term, as the robustness of the revival is \nstill questionable and there is a risk of further lockdowns, mainly in the Americas and \nEurope, emerging Asia looks set to continue to outperform (except for the laggards \nin the region, such as Indonesia). As we move further into 2021, we will see a gradual \nshift from growth to value and the cheap countries outside Asia should also benefit \nfrom the revitalisation in earnings and the increase in flows. Here, the preference \nshould  go  to    the  inexpensive  EMEA  countries  with  good  dividend  yield  prospects \nand low positioning, for example, Poland and South Africa. LatAm could follow, but \nvaluations are less appealing; much will depend on the pattern in commodity prices.\n\nEM fixed income\nThe outlook for EM bonds remains mildly positive. The ongoing low-yield environment \ncould attract flows to this asset class, as long as the global economy’s growth becomes \nmore solid. In terms of EM bonds in local currency (GBI), our scenario is coherent with \nfurther  limited  yield  compression,  both  in  nominal  and  real  terms.

EM  central  banks’  monetary  policies  will \nremain quite diversified: still accommodative for some countries, but already moving \nto some tightening in financial conditions in others. EM currencies disappointed in the \nbottoming-out phase this year and are expected to remain volatile but to eventually \nprovide  a  positive  contribution.  Selection  is  key:  LatAm  countries  and  Russia  should \nbenefit from higher oil prices and a cheap currency and so should attract some flows \nin 2021. On the hard currency side, the EMBI diversified spread appears tight in light \nof  current  conditions  and  seems  to  be  already  anticipating  the  recovery  we  have  in \nmind  for  2021.  We  see  a  stabilisation  in  the  EMBI  diversified  spread  during  the  year \nto a level close to 390, supported by a continuing recovery in EM GDP, a positive EM-\nDM GDP gap (even if turning less positive in the second half of 2021), a stabilisation in \nvolatility and a supportive commodity outlook. On the negative side, debt is expected \nto increase but liquidity and support from institutions will remain very high, so the risk \nof  defaults  is  contained.

We  see  a  broad  but  contained  USD  sell-off,  with \ncommodities-related currencies the relative winners.\n\nInvestment convictions\n\nA shift from contraction to recovery will likely put the USD under \npressure\nAs described in the previous pages, we see the case for a switch from contraction to \nrecovery the further we move into 2021. The scenario is unfavourable for the USD, which \nremains 7% overvalued with respect to our fundamental framework. We see the relative \noverperformance  of  US  assets  and  the  too-high  hedging  costs  as  the  main  reasons \nbehind the persistent USD deviation from fundamentals we have seen in the recent past. \n\nHowever, Covid-19 has shifted the balance out of the US, suggesting investors will try \nto reposition to more under-owned, dislocated assets. In fact, the USD has lost two of \nits main cyclical drivers of the recent past. Its growth premium vs. the rest of the G10 \ncountries collapsed in 2020 and the Fed has almost entirely removed the USD rates \nadvantage that made the greenback a profitable investment opportunity as well as a \n\nAnchored nominal rates and rising inflation expectations depressed US \nreal rates relative to rest of G10 FX\n\n  1.5\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2\n\n1\n\n.5\n\n0\n\n -0.5\n\n \n\n-1\n\n -1.5\n\n \n\n%\n\n09 \n\n10 \n\n11 \n\n12 \n\n13 \n\n14 \n\n15 \n\n16 \n\n17 \n\n18 \n\n19  20\n\n  DXY 10Y Real rates vs G10 Avg\u2003   DXY Spot - RHS\n\nSource: Analysis by Amundi Research, Bloomberg. Barclays, as of 26 October 2020.\n\n18  For professional investors only \n\ndefensive play. Against such a backdrop, we believe a convergence to fundamentals \nwill occur in 2021. \n\nHowever, there are key elements that suggest a complete mean reversion is unlikely. \nFirst,  G10  FX  dynamics  remain  highly  linked  to  investor  sentiment  and  risky  asset \nperformance. We never left “mood on, mood off” dynamics and we see an imminent \ninversion of that trend as unlikely. Second, although the fiscal package in the US is \nexpected  to  be  lower  in  size  without  a  “Biden  Blue  Wave  scenario”,  the  additional \nboost to US growth should not be underestimated. While we believe the short-term \nimpact would be USD negative (on the back of improving risk sentiment), this in turn \ncould lead to a renewed cyclicality in support of the greenback. This is something that \nwould limit, in our view, the USD’s potential correction even if monetary tightening is \nfar from the Fed’s radar. \n\nG10 currencies: a broad but contained USD sell-off, with commodities-\nrelated currencies as relative winners\nThe agreement on the EU recovery fund has been a game changer. It enhanced fiscal \nsolidarity and created a valid alternative to US treasuries for fixed income investors.\n\nHowever, the implementation risks remain high and confirmation that the economic \nrecovery  is  proceeding  at  the  pace  markets  are  pricing  in  remains  crucial.  A  broad \nUSD  move  lower  is  expected,  but  considering  the  higher  policy  flexibility  and  the \ndirect link to China, we believe commodities-related currencies will be the relative \nwinners in G10, with NZD the relative loser in the group. \n\nEMFX: volatility to remain throughout 2021, but some appreciation \non the cards\nThe carry has disappeared in many EM countries. The asset class will remain volatile \nbut, overall, our internal scenario is coherent with, on average, a +2% upside over a \n12-month horizon. Moreover, the expected recovery in commodity prices is potentially \nvery  supportive  for  undervalued  currencies  such  as  LatAm  FX  and  the  rouble.  The \nstill-attractive rates differential, the relatively more benign growth environment and \nthe opening of the bond market should support CNY in 2021.\n\n110\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\nI\nn\nd\ne\nx\n \nl\ne\nv\ne\nl\n\n2021 INVESTMENT OUTLOOK\x0cCommodities: positive outlook even in a tepid recovery\n\nThe outlook is positive for commodities, despite the fragile recovery, as financial conditions are now more relevant in driving commodities dynamics and these are expected \nto remain supportive.\n\nInvestment convictions\n\nGlobal commodities: besides the economic cycle, financial \nconditions are now a key element in the pricing equation.\nHistorically, commodities have been driven by economic growth, supply and demand \nand  inventories  cycle  assumptions.  However,  in  the  last  20  years,  globalisation  and \nfinancial conditions have also impacted these asset classes, as they have others. \n\nThus, in addition to the economic cycle, currencies and more recently the financial \nreflation generated by central banks’ monetary policies, have become crucial factors \nin the expectations for commodities (especially gold and precious metals). Overall, \ndespite a muted recovery, financial conditions remain supportive for commodities as \nwe expect the dollar to depreciate vs. EUR, JPY and CNY, while CBs are expected to \ncontinue to expand their balance sheets.\n\nWTI oil to stay in the $40-50 range in H1 2021 due to the gradual \npickup in demand and the active management of supply by OPEC+.\nOPEC+  countries  succeeded  in  mitigating  the  extreme  oversupply  that  occurred \nafter  the  economic  lockdown.  The  ongoing  process  of  supply-demand  adjustment \nis helping oil to move into the range we expect for 2021. Global consumption should \nrecover by 6% to 99 mln bl/d in 2021, reaching levels close to pre-Covid-19 levels. In \naddition, financial conditions should be supportive as energy prices are very sensitive \nto FX and we expect the dollar to depreciate. \n\nBase metals should keep recovering in 2021, in line with China’s \ngrowth and a manufacturing rebound from depressed levels.\nThe  pandemic  significantly  hit  base  metals  in  2021.  Aluminium,  copper,  lead  and \ntin    look  significantly  undervalued  should  our  central  case  of  a  gradual  recovery \nmaterialise in 2021. The downside risks are clearly related to the second wave of the \nvirus and another global economic freezing. \n\nFinancial conditions also remain supportive for base metals, although not enough to \noffset the economic cooling down risk.\n\n40%\n\n30%\n\n20%\n\n10%\n\n  0\n\nEasing central banks and economic uncertainty remain powerful \ndrivers for gold and precious metals.\nGold and precious metals are the assets benefiting the most from the new paradigm \nof  monetary  policy.  This  will  be  the  key  factor  to  watch  for  2021  as  the  most  likely \nscenario is for ultra-dovish central banks. Such an environment should help real rates \nto stay close to current levels, which could lead gold to drift higher. The weak dollar, a \nfragile recovery and the relatively strong CNY are other supportive factors. \n\nFor all the above reasons, we reiterate our call for having structural gold exposure \nand not just considering it for hedging purposes.\n\nCommodity outlook for 2021\n\nExpected returns for 2021 to reach \nAmundi forecast fair value\n\nSensitivity\n\nMacro\n\nFX\n\nCBs\n\nPrecious \nmetals\n\nBase \nmetals\n\n-\n\n++\n\n-\n\n+\n\n++\n\n+\n\n--\n\nGlobal Precious \n\nEnergy\n\nmetals\n\nBase \nmetals\n\nEnergy\n\n++\n\n++\n\nSource: Analysis by Amundi Research, Bloomberg and US Department of Energy (DOE).

In 2021, more than ever, real assets are likely to be a source of attractive risk-adjusted returns.\n\nInvestment convictions\n\nThe  Covid-19  crisis  has  caused  significant  disruption  in  private  markets,  with \nfundraising and deal making being impacted since the start of 2020. While activity \nis  not  at  the  record  highs  seen  in  recent  years,  funds  are  still  raising  capital,  and \nmanagers  are  putting  money  to  work,  as  investor  appetite  for  real  assets  stays \nunabated.  Global  private  markets  have  topped  $10tn  in  terms  of  assets  under \nmanagement  (AuM)  as  of  October  2020  and  should  grow  up  to  $17.2tn  by  2025, \naccording to Preqin. Most investors build their exposure to private markets via regular \ncommitments,  irrespective  of  market  conditions.  For  investors  looking  for  a  good \nmarket  timing,  the  GFC  showed  that  private  capital  funds  that  deployed  money \nthroughout  the  crisis  produced  among  the  strongest  returns.  The  GFC  and  the \nCovid-19  crisis  are  different  in  many  ways.  Currently,  liquidity  is  abundant  and  CBs \nhave  been  much  more  accommodative  than  they  were  in  2008-11.  Fundraising  will \nbe supported by this liquidity. Market activity will benefit from the high level of dry \npowder. Given the current market circumstances of low or negative interest rates and \nvolatile equity markets, real assets offer among the best risk-adjusted returns in the \nuniverse  of  investable  assets.  To  capture  the  different  premiums  embedded  in  real \nasset investing, increased selectivity is mandatory. Only the best quality assets should \nbe  considered:  Core  and  Core  plus  assets  in  RE  and  Infrastructure,  senior  secured \ninstruments in PD, growth capital and LBO investing in the winning industries for PE. \nPrivate markets are witnessing strong divergences among sectors, and a dichotomy \nbetween healthy sectors with stable price and deal volumes, whereas some sectors \nare  strongly  affected  by  the  crisis  with  almost  no  deal  activity.  Distinguishing  the \nformer from the latter is key to protect the income generation engine that real assets \noffer.  Diversification  in  exposure  and  asset  selection  is  key  to  benefit  from  what \nprivate markets can offer to long-term investors. \n\nReal assets are key in the strategic asset allocation as they are a portfolio \ndiversifier and volatility dampener. Given their long-term nature, investors should \nnot rush tactically into these assets and be selective in order to capture the \ndifferent premiums embedded in real asset investing.\n\nn\nt\n$\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n20  For professional investors only \n\nPrivate equity (PE)\nThe PE market is sending messages that are complicated to interpret, as valuations \nhave fallen relatively little, with a situation that is similar to the listed equity market \nthat  has  not  really  fallen  significantly  either.  However,  for  both  listed  and  unlisted \nequity  markets,  this  goes  along  with  strong  divergences  between  sectors,  and  the \ncrisis  exacerbates  the  winners  vs  losers’  state  of  play.  We  see  companies  that  are \ndoing  well  with  good  cash  flows  or  even  emerging  strengthened  by  the  crisis  vs \ncompanies  that  are  doing  less  well  but  may  offer  good  opportunities  in  terms  of \nentry prices. Despite the disruption, 2020 has been another active year for the PE \nindustry globally and in Europe. European PE raised about €50bn in H120, in line with \nthe first half of 2019. In addition, investment remained resilient, with almost €40bn \ndeployed  and  more  than  3,000  companies  backed  and  over  50%  of  the  money \ndirected at the IT, healthcare and biotech sectors, showing the key role that PE plays \nin innovation (European venture capital enjoyed a record half year, with investment \napproaching €13bn). \n\nAlternative AuM and forecasts\n\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n1\n1\n0\n2\n\n2\n1\n0\n2\n\n3\n1\n0\n2\n\n4\n1\n0\n2\n\n5\n1\n0\n2\n\n6\n1\n0\n2\n\n7\n1\n0\n2\n\n8\n1\n0\n2\n\n9\n1\n0\n2\n\n0\n2\n0\n2\n\n1\n2\n0\n2\n\n2\n2\n0\n2\n\n3\n2\n0\n2\n\n4\n2\n0\n2\n\n5\n2\n0\n2\n\nSource: Preqin data and forecasts as of 12 November 2020, 2020 figure is annualised based on data up to October.\n\n2021 INVESTMENT OUTLOOK\x0cPD should see a shift towards safer, more senior, and more secured strategies\n\nDespite the adverse environment, European private debt funds have seen a rush of capital, raising €21bn in the first half of 2020, as investors seek to take advantage of \npotential counter-cyclical investments. In the coming months, we will have to deal with the many difficult situations and restructuring processes. \n\nInvestment convictions\n\nIn the coming months, we expect to see an acceleration in corporate consolidations in \nmost sectors, as many unlisted companies will emerge weakened from the crisis, with \nhigher debt levels. Companies will need to strengthen their equity -- in some cases, \nsignificantly -- and many will not be able to find refinancing solutions through bank \ncredit lines. Many small to medium businesses will have to call on private funding and \nPE. Structured equity can help entrepreneurs get through the crisis, and this is what \nPE funds using minority stakes investment strategies would typically do, mainly by \nusing preference shares. \n\nOverall, performances of PE funds should emerge stronger in the aftermath of the \nCovid-19 crisis, and we believe it is an extremely attractive time to invest in PE for \ninvestors who can bear some liquidity constraints. As evidenced by fundraising \nnumbers, money has been funneling into the asset class from long-term investors, \nsuch as pension funds or insurance companies, and we expect the trend to \ncontinue in 2021 with the continuation of the crisis.\n\nPrivate debt (PD)\nThere are now a record-high 486 funds on the road, seeking $239bn in aggregate capital \nglobally. This is quite aligned with LPs’ intentions that point to further growth over the \nmedium term for the asset class, with a 2% median current allocation vs a 3-4% target. \nLPs have appetite for PD because it provides better diversification, reliable income \nstreams,  high  risk-adjusted  returns,  and  low  volatility.  Investors  also  appreciate  the \nembedded option that is offered by PD over traditional liquid credit in the uncertain \nenvironment  of  the  Covid-19  crisis  –  i.e.,  the  stringent  financial  documentation,  the \nability to restructure pricing or terms, the floating rates, the ability to repossess hard \nassets if needs be, and the option to exit at par. In 2021, we will enter a new phase of \nthe Covid-19 crisis environment for PD, where we will see a lot of work being done \non the portfolios with much significant restructuring. In terms of dealmaking activity, \ninvestment opportunities should flourish for PD funds in the next 1-18 months, where \nwe  should  see  less  banking  competition,  coupled  with  huge  financing  needs  from \nissuers. Banks balance sheet have been highly mobilised in the past months with a \nlot of provisioning and an increased cost of risk that has led banks to reprice their \ncredit offer. We should see a lower level of banks’ underwriting for mid- to large-cap \n\n21  For professional investors only \n\ndeals. For issuers, we expect the Covid-19 crisis to create opportunities in M&A and \nconsolidation. The crisis has also highlighted the need to adapt most business models \nwhich will require capital expenditure, e.g., the length and complexity of supply chains \nor  digital  underinvestment,  which  will  require  capital  expenditure.  Finally,  balance \nsheets’ re-leveraging will require indebtedness rescheduling, where PD’s bullet profile \ncould emerge as a critical tool. The PD market is much larger than it was at the time of \nthe GFC, and there is a lot of dry powder. With such an abundant capital available in \nthe asset class, stringent selectivity will be key to deliver on PD’s promises. We expect \na flight to quality, with people wanting to invest in safer strategies, more senior, more \nsecured, and in asset-based financing. This crisis will be a test for some LPs and GPs. \nWe  expect  to  see  an  increase  in  European  defaults  that  should  be  concentrated  in \ncertain  sectors  (e.g.,  airline,  oil  &  gas,  travel/  leisure...)  and  typology  of  companies \n(poor  governance,  SMEs).  Broad  diversification  in  geography  and  sector  will  be \nparamount, together with investing at the top of the capital structure, where risk-\nadjusted returns are the most attractive. \n\nEuropean PD dry powder \n\nn\nb\n$\n\n100\n\n75\n\n50\n\n25\n\n0\n\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n1\n1\n0\n2\n\n2\n1\n0\n2\n\n3\n1\n0\n2\n\n4\n1\n0\n2\n\n5\n1\n0\n2\n\n6\n1\n0\n2\n\n7\n1\n0\n2\n\n8\n1\n0\n2\n\n9\n1\n0\n2\n\nt\np\ne\nS\n\n0\n2\n0\n2\n\n  Dry powder\n\nSource: Amundi, Preqin. Data and forecasts as of 13 November 2020.\n\n2021 INVESTMENT OUTLOOK\x0cInvestment convictions\n\nReal estate: opportunities from recent repricing, with differences among sectors \n\nRE investment has solid fundamentals that can help investors to seize opportunities arising from fast-growing trends in offices, retail or logistics. We see the crisis as an \nopportunity to adjust RE market value scales, focusing on core assets and diversification. \n\nReal estate (RE)\nIn the unprecedented and evolving context of the Covid-19 crisis, global commercial \nRE markets saw a YoY decline in deal activity as of September 2020 and fund raising \nexperienced a sharp YoY drop in 3Q20. While some investors opted for a wait-and-\nsee  attitude,  the  ongoing  repricing  in  some  market  segments  could  attract  new \ncommitments. We believe the flight to quality observed since March should continue, \non  the  back  of  the  current  uncertainty  around  the  second  wave  of  the  pandemic. \nThis should benefit core assets and properties whose tenants boast strong balance \nsheets. Investors still feel comfortable transacting high-quality assets, as the assets’ \nvalue  should  be  more  resilient  than  for  secondary  assets.  So  far,  repricing  has  hit \nrisky assets, and we expect to see a scale of value among properties according to \nlocation, tenant’s financial robustness, and asset’s intrinsic features, something that \nhad been dissipating before the crisis. This is especially true for properties on the \nperiphery and those not dedicated to a specific business sector. We believe investors \nwill monitor the leasing markets, particularly rents. The crisis has occurred in a healthy \nleasing market for logistics and offices in Europe, with an office vacancy rate that is \non average lower than before the GFC. Despite a rise in 3Q20, office vacancy rates \nremain at low levels in the central business districts of the main European markets, \nlimiting the impact on rents. Low interest rates should support the recovery, starting \nfrom high-risk premiums on European prime real estate yields, many above 300bps \nas of September 2020. Finally, the impact of the pandemic is not linear, with some \nreal estate sectors hit harder than others. \n\n\x83\x83 We  expect  the  office  sector  to  refocus  on  core  assets  and  remain  relatively \nunscathed  for  the  best  quality  assets.  There  are  many  long-term  leases  in  the \nmarket  and  many  firms  have  been  able  to  adapt  to  social  distancing  and  are \noperating  with  a  mobile  workforce  using  technology.  Remote  working  could \naccelerate,  but  without  disputing  that  working  from  the  office  drives  corporate \nculture, brand and team-building. \n\n\x83\x83 Logistics  has  benefited  from  high  e-commerce  activity,  with  a  greater  need  for \nindustrial warehousing and logistics properties, although a multichannel retailing \nstrategy should become the norm. Since investors see online retailing as a long-\n\nterm trend, logistics properties can be pricy. The boom in online sales has hit non-\nfood shops harder. With new lockdowns in Europe, some retailers may have more \ndifficulties paying high rents this time round. \n\n\x83\x83 Lastly, the hotel industry could suffer the effects of the crisis for longer, assuming \nits model is not called into question. Although the Covid-19 crisis strongly affected \nretail  and  hospitality,  they  could  present  some  investment  opportunities  in  the \nlonger run, when market fundamentals get rebalanced. \n\nInfrastructure\nFew investors were exposed to infrastructure during the GFC. Today, the asset class \nis  undergoing  its  first  global  crisis  and  investors  prize  its  ability  to  resist  market \nturbulence. As for most private markets, we see divergences between sectors in terms \nof  deal  activity  and  valuation.  The  high  level  of  dry  powder  that  existed  before  the \ncrisis is smoothing deal activity in ‘safe-haven’ sectors such as health, technology or \nrenewables, where a stable number of transactions is happening. In the most affected \nsectors, such as transportation or midstream energy, there might be opportunities at \ndiscount  prices,  whereas  we  might  see  some  pricier  assets  in  health  or  technology. \nOverall,  valuations  should  stay  flattish.  Such  stability  confirms  a  core  feature  of \ninfrastructure:  its  long-term  time  horizon.  Prices  may  be  more  attractive  in  some \nsectors today, but it will not make a big difference in terms of returns in the long run. \nBuy-and-hold strategies are gaining more traction in this environment. Infrastructure \nis  a  multi-faceted  asset  class  that  encompasses  a  complex  mapping  of  risks,  such \nas  regulatory  risks,  political  risks,  country-level  risks,  and  industrial  risks. We  believe \ndiversification is key in this asset class in order to deliver the stable return pattern that \ninvestors expect. Finally, the Covid-19 crisis should lead to a supportive political and \nregulatory environment, as the pandemic has emphasised the need for communication \nand social infrastructures, but also for more renewable energy.\n\nInfrastructure projects should be a key component of most governmental \nstimulus plans, and we expect to see a rise in greenfield projects. In that context, \nprivate capital should play a vital role, as the crisis has put a strain on national \ndebt in most countries.\n\n22  For professional investors only \n\n2021 INVESTMENT OUTLOOK\x0cESG Focus\n\nTime to become forward-looking in ESG investing\n\nWhen moving the ESG analysis from a simple snapshot in time to a more forward-looking approach, a natural integration between ESG and financial analysis is required. The \nresult will be greater analysis, a deeper understanding of the fundamental drivers and potentially, improved performance.\n\nMoving into 2021, ESG investing will witness three broad trends: (1) an increased focus \non the ‘E’ and ‘S’ components; (2) a reduction of the gap between the US and Europe \non ESG issues; and (3) the rising importance of ESG improvers.\n\nE and S in focus after the Covid-19 crisis\nWith its triple hit on education, income and health, the Covid-19 crisis has exacerbated \nexisting inequalities. According to the World Bank, about 88 million people (115 million \nin a downside scenario) could be pushed into extreme poverty in 2020 as a result of the \npandemic.1 From an investment perspective, the rise in inequality represents a threat \nto  financial  stability  and  could  affect  asset  values.  Therefore,  we  believe  the  current \ncrisis will accelerate investors’ focus on the ‘social’ aspect, even as the ‘environment’ \nangle  remains  in  the  limelight.  In  addition  to  identifying  idiosyncratic  risks,  green  or \nenvironment-friendly investing will serve as a means to support the economic recovery. \nIn Europe, as part of its €750bn recovery fund, the EU announced a plan to sell green \nbonds  worth  €225bn  —  almost  equal  to  the  global  total  in  2019  —  to  boost  green \ninfrastructure.2\n\nUS closing the gap with Europe\nThe  average  support  for  environmental  and  social  shareholder  resolutions  from  the \nrecent  proxy  season  was  just  over  29%  among  S&P  500  companies,  very  close  to \nthe average support levels of governance-oriented resolutions for the first time ever.3 \nSecond, while Europe is the global ESG leader in terms of climate policies and AuM, \nthe US is catching up. US ESG assets had increased from $96bn in 2017 to $145bn as \nof July 2020. \n\nn\nb\n\nThe case for investing in ESG improvers\nThe key question for investors remains how to benefit from this mainstreaming of ESG.  \nWhile  investing  in  ESG  leaders  is  one  way  to  generate  better  risk-adjusted  returns, \nESG improvers (companies with a positive ESG momentum) present, in our view, an \nattractive opportunity to generate even higher returns. Investors could target a wide \nrange of corporates that are not yet ESG leaders. to harvest the future ESG premium \nby  investing  in  tomorrow’s  ESG  winners  and  obtain  better  risk-adjusted  return  and \nbetter ESG impact.In our view, a combination of the ESG improvers and leaders should \n\n 150\n\n 120\n\n  90\n\n  60\n\n  30\n\n  0\n\n1World Bank, 2Bloomberg, 3Goldman Sachs. ESG winners/leaders are quality companies with attractive valuations and strong ESG ratings, while \nESG improvers are corporates portraying a solid fundamental investment case and an improving ESG trend, but that are not yet ESG leaders.\n\n23  For professional investors only \n\nallow investors to extract value before a trend materialises and before the premium is \nestablished. This can be done by:\n\n\x83\x83 Identifying  the  ESG  drivers  that  are  material  to  a  corporate’s  ESG  profile.  For \ninstance, the CO2 footprint is key for an energy company but less so for telecoms;\n\n\x83\x83 Identifying the financial impact of those drivers through both ESG and financial \n\nanalysis; and\n\n\x83\x83 Understanding  how  these  drivers  have  changed  in  the  past,  and  assessing  how \n\nthey will change in the future.\n\nWe believe that an optimal portfolio will combine both features, with the ESG \nleaders acting as a sound quality foundation, while the improvers offer an additional \nsource of potential growth and return.\n\nInvestor interest in ESG is rewarded by performance\n\nSocial bonds market,  bn\n\nThree-year equity performance\n\n143\n\n105\n\n 50%\n\n 40%\n\n 30%\n\n 20%\n\n 10%\n\n 0%\n\n-10%\n\n38\n\n22 16\n\n8 10 11\n\n7\n1\n0\n2\n\n8\n1\n0\n2\n\n9\n1\n0\n2\n\n0\n2\n0\n2\n\n1 1\n\n5\n1\n0\n2\n\n1 2\n6\n1\n0\n2\n\n  New issuance\u2003   Cumulative issuance\n  Expon.

Core plus \nproperty owners typically have the ability to increase cash flows through light property improvements, management efficiencies or by increasing the quality of the tenants. Similar to \ncore properties, these properties tend to be of high quality and well occupied. \n\n\x83\x83 Core real estate investment strategy: ‘Core’ is synonymous with ‘income’ in the stock market. Core property investors are conservative investors looking to generate stable income \n\nwith very low risk. Core properties require very little hand-holding by their owners and are typically acquired and held as an alternative to bonds. \n\n\x83\x83 Correlation: the degree of association between two variables; in finance, it is the degree to which assets or asset class prices have moved in relation to each other. Correlation is \n\nexpressed by a correlation coefficient that ranges from -1 (perfectly negative correlated) through 0 (absolutely independent) to 1 (perfectly positive correlated).\n\n\x83\x83 Credit spread: the differential between the yield on a credit bond and the Treasury yield.

Default rate based on BofA indices. Universe consists of issuers in the \n\ncorresponding index 12 months prior to the date of default. Indices considered for corporate market are ICE BofA.\n\n\x83\x83 Diversification: Diversification is a strategy that mixes a variety of investments within a portfolio, in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk.\n\x83\x83 Dry powder: It refers to cash reserves kept on hand by a company, venture capital firm or individual to cover future obligations, purchase assets or make acquisitions. Securities \nconsidered dry powder could be Treasuries or other short-term fixed income investment that can be liquidated on short notice in order to provide emergency funding or allow an \ninvestor to purchase assets.\n\n\x83\x83 Duration: a measure of the sensitivity of the price (the value of principal) of a fixed income investment to a change in interest rates, expressed as a number of years.\n\x83\x83 FX: FX markets refer to the foreign exchange markets where participants are able to buy and sell currencies.\n\x83\x83 GP: General partner, a fund manager that raises capital from institutional investors through open-ended or closed-ended fund structures or non-fund vehicles with fund-like economics.\n\x83\x83 LBO: Leveraged buyout.

Under this transition phase, the market doesn’t crash, but doesn’t rally either and investors will have to stay cautious and watch out for tactical opportunities waiting for the next big directional catalyst.\x0cLetter from the CIOs\n\nPascal BLANQUÉ \nGroup Chief  \nInvestment Officer\n\nVincent MORTIER \nDeputy Group Chief \nInvestment Officer\n\nAfter enjoying stellar performance this year, moving into 2020, investors will increasingly ask whether the global economy will proceed towards a \ntrade war-engineered recession or whether growth will stabilise at a low level and potentially rebound, meaning the cycle could extend even further. In \nour view, the retreat in global trade is causing a major change in the structure of growth, but does not point to a full-blown recession, especially at a \ntime when cumulative loose policies are gearing up and a partial deal between the US and China is in sight. Monetary and fiscal policy combination, \na prominent theme going forward, may extend the current cycle further. While the noise on trade-related issues will be high, a material escalation is \nunlikely given the upcoming US elections in 2020. However, the path for investors will not be linear. In the short term, market expectations for policy \nactions have gone too far and need to be adjusted. The adjustment process will drive volatility in bonds, with a bottoming out of core bond yields \nhaving already started, and re-rating in some expensive defensive sectors in equity. Beyond the short term, the trend is towards a more aggressive \npolicy mix that could potentially reach “the next level” of unorthodox measures when the risk of recession intensifies. The result will be an extension of \nthe credit cycle that could eventually end in an explosion, although it is unlikely to happen next year. In terms of investment strategy for 2020, instead \nof fearing a global recession, investors should focus on adjusting their portfolio exposure to the deglobalisation trend. They should also prepare for \na mature and extended credit cycle, with higher liquidity risks. \n\nAgainst this backdrop, we envisage four main themes for investors.\nEquity investing for 2020 will be, in our view, a story of income and opportunities for a potential upside. The lack of strong directional trends in the \nmarkets will continue as long as earnings growth remains weak. This should drive investors to search for areas of resilience in equity income/dividend \nspace. Once the outlook stabilises, and yields bottom out (Purchasing Manager Indices rebound, some fiscal expansion), there could be some potential \nfor a continuation of the bull trend, with opportunities for cyclical stocks (quality in Europe, value in US and small cap).\nIn fixed income, it will be a matter of optimising the search for yield, with selection and flexible strategies. The hunt for yield remains a key theme. \nHowever, crowded areas and liquidity risk persist and require a deep dive into credit opportunities. For investors with the appropriate time horizon, \nhigh yield will remain attractive amid a benign default outlook. Higher scrutiny at sector and security levels will be vital to avoid unsustainable business \nmodels. Emerging markets bonds are also attractive for yield hunters, with a preference for hard currency, while opportunities in local currency could \nmaterialise during the year. On the core fixed income component, a flexible and diversified approach is recommended amid higher expected volatility.\nIn emerging markets, new themes will appear from a more fragmented world and a retreat in global trade. Investors will have to go beyond the \ntraditional  “global”  EM  concept  and  dig  deeper  to  capture  attractive  opportunities  and  themes.  Among  the  latter,  we  favour  the  “help  yourself” \ncountries that have strong domestic demand and are less exposed to external vulnerabilities. Alternatively, themes such as the Silk Road will deserve \nincreased investor attention, in our view.\nFinally, investors should start building volatility-proof portfolios. Volatility has been constrained by the proliferation of some investment strategies \n(i.e., selling volatility to get premium), but as market expectations adjust, volatility spikes are likely. To volatility-proof their portfolios, investors should \nconsider liquid alternative strategies that offer low correlation versus traditional asset classes, as well as volatility strategies.\n\n3  For professional investors only \n\n2020 INVESTMENT OUTLOOK\x0cINVESTMENT OUTLOOK 2020\nBe agile to cope with diverging scenarios \n\nFive global themes drive our central and alternative scenarios\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n+\n\nMonetary and fiscal \npolicies combination\n\nGlobal trade: from \nchallenges to opportunities\n\nChina is in between debt \nand economic transition\n\nUS consumers stay \nsufficiently resilient\n\nCorporate earnings and \ndebt conundrum\n\nCENTRAL SCENARIO – Muddling in the middle \n\n55%\n\nUPSIDE SCENARIO – All that glitters is gold \n\n15%\n\nAnalysis\n�  Synchronised stabilisation \n\n�  Low rates, low inflation, low \n\nsingle-digit profits growth for \ncorporates\n\n�  Record high debt (public and \n\ncorporate sectors)\n\n�  This scenario has a prominent \ngeopolitical dimension.

For  the  time \nbeing, no imbalances in the real economy (consumption and investment) have piled \nup, even at a time when the structure of global growth has changed to be less driven \nby global trade amid deglobalisation forces at play. However, some main risks persist \n(see page 10) during this period when the global economy is more vulnerable, as it \nwill progressively transition towards a “correction phase” over the next 18 months (see \ntable).  In  addition,  the  current  environment  has  a  prominent  geopolitical  dimension \nthat affects risk premia. This backdrop calls for a still constructive investment stance, \nbut being aware of possible volatility spikes and areas of liquidity risks. Five key themes \nwill drive the investment journey for 2020:\n\n1. Monetary and fiscal policies combination\nMonetary policy will remain accommodative. The engagement with qualified stimulus \npolicy to offset trade uncertainty will take place only under “crisis management”. In \nthe meanwhile, FX (and the USD in particular) will be a key factor in policy decisions. \n→  Overall,  the  monetary  and  fiscal  policy  combination  is  a  welcome  tailwind  that \ncould offer room for some tactical opportunities, although short-term expectations \nmay have to further downsize first.\n\n2. Global trade: transforming challenges into opportunities \nThe global reassessment of trade dynamics is impacting areas and countries differently. \nWhile the US will need to take a harder stance on China, this is unlikely to take place \nduring the election year (2020). The impact of tariffs in Europe is economically limited \nand we think it is likely the US will team up with Europe against China. Some emerging \nmarkets may benefit from the changes in global trade power. \n→  For  investors,  this  could  offer  opportunities  in  EM  that  are  more  insulated  from \ntrade noise and backed by a credible domestic growth story.\n\n3. China manages its economic transition\nChina will manage the “self-inflicted deceleration” of growth to 5.8% amid an economic \ntransformation to adopt and speed up marketplace practices.\nThis  will  require  addressing  productivity  growth  in  the  medium  to  long  term,  while \navoiding a credit bubble burst in the short term.\n\n→ Investors could look at longer term opportunities linked to China’s development, \nsuch as the New Silk Road initiative.\n\n4. US consumers: sober resilience to see the worst avoided for US \neconomy\nThere is some spillover from manufacturing to services materialising in the total income \ndeceleration  across  all  sectors  (including  both  the  goods  producing  and  service \nsectors)  but  US consumers will remain sufficiently resilient  in 2020 due to healthier \nbalance sheets. \n→ For investors, with no recession in sight, this is not yet the time to be risk-off.\n5. Corporate earnings and debt conundrum\nUS corporate earnings are a key variable for Central Banks to watch. While Fed actions \nwill  aim  to  preserve  easing  financial  conditions,  US  earnings  are  exposed  to  global \ntrade  spillovers  and  are  vulnerable  to  external  risks.  High  corporate  leverage  amid \nsluggish earnings generation is a key feature of this financial regime. \n→ Earnings sustainability should be a key driver of selection.\n\nOur Advanced Investment Phazer \nA late cycle with key peculiarities: pre-emptive monetary policy (vs. on hold) and \nstill high leverage → cycle extension potentially driving a credit bubble \n\nCORRECTION CONTRACTION  REFLATION RECOVERY LATE CYCLE\n\nSluggish \ngrowth, \nmonetary \neasing, profit \nrecession\n\nEconomic \nrecession, \naccommodative \nmonetary policy, \nhigh leverage\n\nPositive \ngrowth, \nunconventional \nmonetary \npolicy, \ndeleveraging\n\nEconomic \nexpansion, \nmonetary \ntightening, \nleverage\n\nPositive \ngrowth, but on \na descending \ntrend, \nmonetary \npolicy on hold, \ndeleveraging\n\n2019  u\n\n2020 u\n\n26%\n\n29%\n\n1%\n\n2%\n\n11%\n\n10%\n\n2021  u\nSource: Investment Phazer Amundi Proprietary Tool.

However, this “reset” will likely take more time than expected.\n\nFinancial repression to persist in world of low growth\nIn a world where nominal potential growth is trending lower (real potential growth has \nweakened as well as inflation), and where at the same time global debt (both private \nand public) has surged, the world needs very accommodative monetary conditions \nfor an extended period of time. As a result, financial repression is here to stay: central \nbanks  (CBs)  are  trapped  in  their  very  accommodative  monetary  policies  (whether \nactive balance sheet management or negative interest rates) in order to smooth the \neconomic impact of the deleveraging process.\n\nFurther monetary policies alone could become counterproductive\nThe long-term impact of “unconventional” monetary policies (securities purchases \nand/or  negative  interest  rates)  is  still  largely  unknown:  CBs  have  never  increased \nthe size of their balance sheets on this scale and nominal rates have never fallen into \nnegative  territory  to  this  extent  (the  Eurozone  and  Japan  account  for  90%  of  the \nnegative  yield  universe).  CBs  are  aware  of  the  limited  effectiveness  of  their  policies \nand  that  these  alone  can  no  longer  allow  them  to  reach  their  inflation  targets.  The \nmarginal impact of any additional accommodation is expected to be much lower (in \nthe  Eurozone  and  Japan)  than  a  few  years  ago.  Moreover,  the  adverse  side  effects \non  financial  institutions  (banks,  insurance  and  pension  funds)  and  on  savers  will \nincreasingly  be  taken  into  account.  With  negative  interest  rates,  eventually  pension \nfunds  will  all  become  underfunded,  and  savings  income  will  collapse  (which  would \nnecessitate – all other things being equal – a rise in the household savings rate). Going \nforward, additional monetary accommodation alone will prove counterproductive. \n\nOn the fiscal side, there is more room for manoeuvre when rates \nare low \nThe fact that the average interest rate paid on public debt has fallen below nominal \nGDP growth is a game-changer for many advanced economies, as it is now possible \nto stabilise the public debt to GDP ratio with a primary deficit. In addition, the debate \non the types of expenditures that should be included in public debt metrics is returning \nto the forefront, notably in the Eurozone. This may pave the way for a more flexible \napproach  on  the  fiscal  side  at  a  global  level  (i.e.,  infrastructure  and  security  needs \ncould be taken into account separately). \n\nMoving towards fiscal and monetary complicity\nThe roles and responsibilities of CBs and governments were quite distinct during the \nGreat  Moderation:  fiscal  policy  was  dedicated  to  cyclical  stabilisation  and  monetary \npolicy  was  dedicated  to  meeting  inflation  targets.  But  with  QE  programmes,  the \nboundary between monetary and fiscal policy has de facto been blurred. Inflation is \npersistently undershooting and subsequently, this role splitting no longer works. \nA closer coordination is required: CBs will need fiscal policy to achieve their goal while, \non  the  other  hand,  governments  will  need  very  accommodative  CBs  to  reflate  their \neconomies. In other words, we have entered into a world of fiscal dominance where \nwe can legitimately question CBs’ independence (new reaction function). Fiscal policy \nshould  gradually  take  over  from  monetary  policy.  Most  central  bankers  emphasise \nthe fact that monetary policy is not the “only game in town”, and that low rates should \nbe used to mobilise fiscal policy, where there is fiscal space. In the EZ, for instance, \nGermany and the Netherlands are asked to mobilise fiscal policy but, as a matter of \nfact, their governments are reluctant to move in this direction. There is a consensus \nto say that policymakers need to rethink their role. But without a trigger (recession \nand/or financial crisis), we believe that this is unlikely to happen. With regard to fiscal/\nmonetary policy, the expectations of investors are thus too elevated in the short run. \nConversely,  in  a  time  of  recession  and/or  crisis,  we  must  not  underestimate  the \ncapacity  (and  the  implicit  commitment)  of  policymakers  to  stabilise  the  situation \n(through new channels such as debt monetisation, the purchase of equities or other \nassets, or even “helicopter money”).\n\nKey Investment Implications\n\n�  Long-term  interest  rates:  low  for  long  (financial  repression  and  fiscal \n\ndominance), albeit not necessarily in negative territory.\n�  Long-term market inflation expectations are excessively low.\n�  No true protection in the short run on potentially illiquid assets (credit)…\n�  …but following a crisis and/or a deep recession, the “new policy mix” would \n\ndefinitely offer new investment opportunities.\n\nQE = quantitiative easing.\n\n6  For professional investors only \n\n2020 INVESTMENT OUTLOOK\x0cGlobal themes\n\nGlobal themes\n\nGlobal trade: Transforming challenges into opportunities\n\nTrade discrimination and protectionist policies have been increasing since the Great Financial Crisis and will result in modest global trade growth in 2020. The world is moving \naway from a global multilateral approach towards a more regional customised approach. Some Emerging Markets are trying to benefit from this transformation.\n\nChange in the global power distribution\nIn 2019 world trade dynamics have definitely shown an accentuation in the inversion of \nthe globalisation trend and its robust contribution to global economic performance. \nThe escalation in the dispute between China and the US has been only the tip of an \niceberg that has been building up since 2008, made up of incremental protectionist \nmeasures  and  subsidies  (to  foreign  competitors,  to  local  farmers  and  to  state  and \nnon-state exporters, to name a few). The World Trade Organization is becoming less \neffective, with fewer and fewer cases of protectionism brought to it. The awareness of \nthe need to reform the global agency is widely felt, less so the appetite to do it. Against \nthis background we approach 2020 assuming that a trade truce between China and \nthe US will be signed in the near future and that the next round of tariffs planned for \nmid-December will be delayed and will continue to be part of an ongoing negotiation. \nAt  this  point  the  damage  to  world  trade  dynamics  has  been  done  and  although \n\nTrade disputes in place since 2008, a story of all against all\n\n66% 68% 67% 69%\n\n71% 73% 74%\n\n58%\n\n53%\n\n46%\n\n35%\n\n0%\n0.0%\n8\n0\n0\n2\n\n0.1% 0.2% 0.3% 0.4% 0.6% 3.1% 0.8% 0.9% 1.1% 1.9% 3.0%\n\n9\n0\n0\n2\n\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n1\n1\n0\n2\n\n2\n1\n0\n2\n\n3\n1\n0\n2\n\n4\n1\n0\n2\n\n5\n1\n0\n2\n\n6\n1\n0\n2\n\n7\n1\n0\n2\n\n8\n1\n0\n2\n\n9\n1\n0\n2\n\n  All trade discriminations \n\n  Discrimination that singles out one exporter\n\nSource: 24Th Global Trade Alert Report.

The  global  multilateral  approach  is  not  completely  dead,  however, \nit  is  transforming  into  a  more  customised/regional  approach  with  a  different  power \ndistribution (USMCA, RCEP and CPTPP at the latest stages of the negotiations). In a \nscenario analysis, we do assign a higher probability to the downside risks, implying a \nfaster escalation in the relationship between China and the US (the truce announced \nwill  not  follow  through)  with  more  persistent  downward  dynamics  in  global  trade \nand therefore a major downward revision in global growth. On the other hand, we do \nassign  a  very  small  probability  to  the  upside,  implying  a  rolling  back  of  the  current \ntariffs in place.\n\nSpotting medium-term winners and losers from the trade war\nThe global reassessment of trade dynamics is impacting areas and countries differently. \nEuropean exports have been strongly hit by generally weak intra-EU demand and \nthe  declining  demand  for  intermediate  and  capital  goods  extra-EU  (especially  Italy \nand Germany). The US is persistently advancing on the path of imports substitution \n(imports of industrial supplies and materials have decreased from 27% of total imports \nin 2007 to 18% in 2019). EM are trying to transform the challenges posed by the trade \ntensions into opportunities. For the two championed winners of the trade war, Mexico \nand Vietnam, there are early trends emerging. Vietnam (CPTPP, FTA with Europe) is \nbenefitting from small business relocation out of China and Mexico is benefitting from \nimports diversion by the US (ex-auto, exports to the US are increasing in electrical and \nelectronic equipment). \n\nInvestors  could  play  regional  divergences  arising  from  protectionist  policies. \nIncreased  fragmentation  and  a  reassessment  of  trade  dynamics  will  define  the \nwinner and losers. European exporters are the most fragile, while countries such as \nMexico and Vietnam could emerge as winners.\n\nRCEP = Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a free-trade agreement among 16 countries in the Asia-Pacific area.  \nCPTPP  = Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership  (CPTPP),  a  free trade agreement  between \nCanada and 10 other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. USMCA = United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\n\n7  For professional investors only \n\n2020 INVESTMENT OUTLOOK\x0cChina: Weaker economy, stronger power of influence in global geopolitics\n\nChinese  economic  conditions  will  continue  on  a  decelerating  path.  The  policy  mix  will  remain  supportive  domestically  and  externally.  China  will  continue  to  broaden  its \ninfluence in the geopolitical landscape (RCEP and Silk Road) and to open its financial markets. This will open up opportunities for investors.\n\nGlobal themes\n\nSlowdown to continue, but China to count more in geopolitical \nlandscape \nIn 2019, China’s economic conditions have been markedly deteriorating even though \nGDP growth has remained in line with the range target announced by authorities (6%-\n6.5%).  We  do  expect  that  next  year’s  target  will  be  lowered  in  consideration  of  the \ndomestic and external factors that are dragging on growth. Our GDP forecast for 2020 \nis now below the 6% threshold at 5.8% YoY. The external shock is going hand in hand \nwith domestic policies aiming at deleveraging the economy and introducing stronger \nregulation, with both policies still compelling notwithstanding the external threat. The \nconfrontational  narrative  between  the  US  and  China  will  remain  in  the  background \n(tariffs and extra tariff measures) and we do not expect any lifting of the tariffs in place. \nIn the short term, we do not expect the last tranche of tariffs to be implemented either. \n\nContribution to credit growth (including government bonds)\n\n%\n\n36\n\n32\n\n28\n\n24\n\n20\n\n16\n\n12\n\n  8\n\n  4\n\n  0\n\n-4\n\nThe evolution of the Phase One deal will dictate the path ahead, at least on the trade \nrelationship.  This  is  why  the  economy  will  continue  its  slowdown,  with  the  private \nmanufacturing sector suffering relatively more than other sectors of the economy.\nOn the external side, the role and influence of China in the geopolitical landscape \nwill  continue  to  grow.  Two  initiatives  are  key:  the  Regional  Comprehensive \nEconomic  Partnership  (RCEP),  for  Asia,  and  Silk  Road,  mainly  for  increasing \ninfluence to the West.\n\nStill supportive policy mix without exaggeration\nChina’s policy mix will continue with its stimulating stance, though in a very limited \nway, and far from the massive stimulus implemented in recent years. On the monetary \npolicy side, the rate cuts will continue to be limited and very much targeted (further \ncuts  of  the  reserve  requirement  ratio  to  come  soon),  while  credit  will  continue  its \nmoderate growth, driven by the core component of Renmimbi loans. The official and \nfund budgets will continue to be supportive. \n\nConstructive outlook on Chinese asset classes\nThe  outlook  on  Chinese  asset  classes  is  constructive.  In  equity,  we  prefer  A-share \nequities, which are more exposed to the domestic economy and policy interventions. \nA-shares will benefit from inflows due to the ongoing MSCI inclusion process. Chinese \nbonds will experience mounting interest from investors and inflows: the process of \ninclusion in the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index has already started, and \nthis will be followed up in February 2020 by the inclusion of liquid Chinese Government \nBonds  (CGBs)  in  the  GBI-EM  index.  These  are  important  steps  along  the  road  to \nopening the country’s capital markets. On the currency, we expect the Yuan to move \nin the range 7.10-7.20 for the next year, heading back to the psychological level of 7 if \nthere is some sort of agreement in the trade dispute. \n\n8\n0\n0\n2\n\n9\n0\n0\n2\n\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n1\n1\n0\n2\n\n2\n1\n0\n2\n\n3\n1\n0\n2\n\n4\n1\n0\n2\n\n5\n1\n0\n2\n\n6\n1\n0\n2\n\n7\n1\n0\n2\n\n8\n1\n0\n2\n\n9\n1\n0\n2\n\nKey Investment Implications\n\n�  Limited risks for financial markets due to China-related issues\n�  Chinese A-shares and Chinese bonds\n�  Silk Road investment opportunities.\n\n  RMB loans\u2003   Corporate bonds\u2003   Gov bonds (local)\u2003 \n  Others (mainly shadow banking)\u2003\u2002   Overall Credit\n\nSource: Analysis by Amundi Research, CEIC.

In aggregate terms, consumption fundamentals remain supported, but under the surface, a few \nelements of vulnerability are emerging, representing downside risks to monitor, in particular in relation to the low to middle income classes.\n\nA sound picture, with moderation in sight\nDeceleration in jobs growth has been in place since early 2019. This hints at a weakness in \nlabour demand, which has been reflected in the recent deceleration in PMI employment \nsurveys.  Although  this  began  in  the  manufacturing  sector  (approx.  10%  of  private \nemployment), the softening of payroll growth is noticeable also in the service sector. \nSimilar  decelerating  patterns  are  visible  in  the  pace  of  growth  of  hours  worked  and \nwages, both in goods production and service sectors. Other measures of labour market \nstrength  hint  at  a  turning  point:  hires,  quits  and  separations  have  plateaued  at  cycle \nhighs, while jobs openings, which were well above the pre-recession peak, have started \nto decline. In addition, the duration of unemployment has started to increase. Consumer \nsentiment,  meanwhile,  remains  elevated,  though  not  improving,  while  expectations \nfor future  economic  performance  are  a  cause  for  concern. We  expect  these  trends \nto  continue  as  the  economy  decelerates.  While  drivers  of  income  are  expected  to \nmoderate, mild inflationary pressures are building and have started to dent households’ \npurchasing power. Overall, we expect a moderation in personal consumption due to \nslowing aggregate income growth (from 2.6% in 2019 to 2.2% in 2021).\n\nTotal Labour Income drives Personal Consumption Expenditure \n\nY\no\nY\n\n  8%\n\n  6%\n\n  4%\n\n  2%\n\n  0%\n\n-2%\n\n-4%\n\n-6%\n\n2007 \n\n2009 \n\n2011 \n\n2013 \n\n2015 \n\n2017 \n\n2019\n\n  Total Labour Income (TLI) Proxy\u2003   Personal Consumption Expenditure\u2003 \n  Consuming Above or Below TLI (RHS)\n\nSource: Amundi Research, Bloomberg, as of 28 October 2019. \n\n9  For professional investors only \n\nUS consumer balance sheet looks broadly healthy, with areas of \nattention\nIn  aggregate,  the  saving  rate  stands  well  above  pre-crisis  levels.  Households’  net \nworth is nearing a peak as a percentage of GDP. Measures of leverage and ability to \npay, such as debt to disposable income – total debt service and households’ financial \nobligation ratios – are all significantly down from the eve of the last recession. However, \nbehind the constructive trend a few vulnerabilities are emerging. The Great Financial \nCrisis (GFC) exacerbated inequality and concentration of risk in some segments of the \npopulation. For instance, while it is true that the aggregate household debt service ratio \nhas steadily declined since 2008, by drilling down into the data, the dichotomy in recent \nyears between consumer credit debt service (steadily increasing) and mortgage debt \nservice (declining) is evident. At the same time, while aggregated delinquency rates \nhave declined, serious delinquencies for auto loans and credit cards have increased in \nthe last few years. Exposure to credit card and consumer credit is not homogeneous \nacross households, being more concentrated in lower income levels.\n\nThe middle and lower income classes are the most vulnerable \nThe  middle  and  lower  income  classes  are  of  most  concern,  having  the  highest \npropensity to consume and being the most significant driver of household demand. \nCorporate  equities  and  mutual  fund  shares  account  for  9.5%  of  net  worth  in  the  \n50%-90% income percentile, leaving these consumers exposed to a correction in the \nequity market. Lower incomes are more vulnerable to a labour market downturn, as \noften they have only one source of income, often not full-time, and few liquid assets \n(liquid assets to liability ratio has not recovered to pre-2000s levels yet).\n\nKey Investment Implications\n\n�  High yield supported by resilient demand and limited defaults\n�  Consumer discretionary and financials attractive\n�  US municipals have a higher return profile\n�  Securitised credit in focus.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4%\n\n3%\n\n2%\n\n1%\n\n0%\n\n-1%\n\n-2%\n\n-3%\n\nY\no\nY\n\n2020 INVESTMENT OUTLOOK\x0cCorporate earnings vulnerabilities amid high debt: Focus on sustainability\n\nWe expect global earnings per share growth in the lower single digit space. FX dynamics and spreads are the main areas to monitor as the materialisation of downside risk \nmight be sudden and impactful in a world washed by debt. This environment calls for a strong focus on sustainability of earnings and debt.\n\nGlobal themes\n\nGlobal trade, FX and financial conditions key for earnings generation\nTightening financing conditions on a stronger USD/weaker EM FX and trade disputes \nwere  strong  headwinds  to  corporate  profits  this  year.  They  entered  a  prolonged \ndownward  revision  cycle,  as  earnings  expectations  were  very  high.  To  assess  the \ndirection  for  next  year,  it  is  vital  to  look  at  the  different  components  of  earnings. \nBased on our analysis, most of the top line components are currently flashing red and \nwould point to a profit recession (sales YoY growth, trade weighted dollar, capex, PMI, \netc., with the only exception of unemployment).

In our view, an outlook of moderate growth, \nresilience of the consumer sector, an easing of trade tensions, at least partially, and \neasing  financial  conditions  (in  particular  a  stable/slightly  weakening  dollar)  are \nconsistent with single-digit earnings growth for next year, below the consensus. \n\nCorporate leverage is the main area of attention\nA  key  area  of  attention  for  this  outlook,  on  top  of  FX  dynamics,  will  be  corporate \nleverage.  US  corporate  debt  is  today  at  record  high  levels.  In  recent  years,  US \ncompanies have poured a huge amount into financial markets to finance record levels \nof share buybacks and M&A activities. Leverage is high today, especially if we take into \nconsideration the fact that the economy is in an extended expansion phase. Previous \npeaks were recorded following a recession, against a backdrop of depressed profits. Very \naccommodative monetary policies are helping. In the Investment Grade (IG) universe, \nthe  interest  coverage  ratio  remains  adequate,  but  is  disappointing  considering  that \ninterest rates are historically low. However, the number of High Yield (HY) firms with \nvery low interest coverage ratios remains high. US companies are now facing growing \nrefinancing needs. We are now seeing record issuance on the corporate bond primary \nmarket, both in the US and the Eurozone. A large portion of this rise in euro and dollar \nvolumes  could  be  attributed  to  US  companies’  refinancing  needs.  The  level  of  cash \nremains  generally  good  but  is  down  compared  with  short-term  refinancing  needs. \nMoreover,  cash  is  concentrated  in  some  sectors/issuers  (mostly  in  the  technology \nsector). In this environment, a tightening of financial conditions would be difficult to \nsustain, leading to material pressure on corporate sector debt sustainability. This is \nnot our main scenario but deserves attention. \n\nIn a late cycle, with fragility building up, investors should increase their scrutiny on \nsustainability  of  debt  and  earnings  at  the  single  stock  level,  looking  for  possible \nareas of strain. A focus on equity resilience will be key in 2020. \n\nThe interest coverage ratio is a debt ratio and profitability ratio used to determine how easily a company can pay interest on its \noutstanding debt.\n\n2020 INVESTMENT OUTLOOK\x0cRisks to Watch\n\nMarket Impact\n\n�  Negative for equity and CNY\n�  Positive for USD, US Treasury  \n\nand gold\n\n�  Negative for risky assets\n�  US IG BBB downgrade, EURO and US \n\nHY B-CCC default increase\n\n�  Positive for USD, US Treasury and gold\n\nThe most complex issues (intellectual property rights, technology transfers, tariffs already in \nplace and the Huawei case) have not been addressed yet.

The earnings revisions for next year will turn \npositive after Q1 that could be more challenging. Better earnings, positive liquidity and low interest rates may support the equity market, as far as the trade war does \nnot intensify.\n\nEurope\n\n=/+\n\nEurope has suffered during this cycle from underperforming profits, strong international exposure and political risks, however, these negative factors are fading as the \nprobability of a Brexit deal increases. Should a bottoming out of global manufacturing materialise, Europe will benefit more than others. A shift to value would also \nbe a positive.\n\nJapan has experienced ups and downs in this cycle and was among the worst performers until August in 2019. Earnings growth has delivered less than the rest of \nthe world since 2016, and this should be the case again next year. But Japan can benefit from a shift to value. It remains also under the influence of the Yen and is \nsensitive to geopolitical risks.\n\nEarnings revisions are bottoming out. We expect domestic stories to remain resilient and provide good opportunties for investors. We are constructive on China \nA-shares.\n\n=\n=/+ We maintain our preference for US Treasuries duration vs. other developed markets, on better absolute and relative valuations and the Fed having more leeway at its \n\ndisposal on conventional tools. We expect a steepening of the US yield curve.\n\n=/+\n\nDovish central banks are overall supportive of the credit market, therefore, US corporate bonds are supported as well by favourable technicals, though not to the \nsame extent as EUR IG, as CSPP and negative rates are a European peculiarity. However, given lingering macro uncertainties, we prefer to keep a cautious attitude on \ncredit risk, favouring high quality carry and increasing the focus on liquidity assessment.\n\nValuations of US HY spreads look tighter than in other credit segments and we prefer high quality over lower rated names, on more idiosyncratic risks and rising \ndefault risks, together with liquidity reasons. Sector selection remains key, as distress looks concentrated in a few sectors.\n\n=\n-/= Among European government bonds, we remain constructive on the main peripheral European countries (Spain and Italy), fuelled by ECB action, a new political \nWe are positive on Euro IG, particularly on BBB-rated debt and financials.

Curves are expected to flatten on the back of persisting yield hunting.\n\n++\n\nTechnicals are favourable: we prefer high quality and more liquid BB-rated debt on the back of the attractive risk reward combination, given higher downside risks to \nthe macro picture.

Keep an eye on a \nbottoming out of PMI manufacturing indices, a re-steepening of the yield curve and a downturn in the dollar before moving to a contrarian stance.\n\nISM Manufacturing and 2Y bond yield change\n\nInvestment convictions\n\n2020 consensus earnings forecasts are still too high\nThis cycle is 10 years old in 2019. During that time, aggregate earnings have surprised \non  the  upside  in  only  three  years  (2011,  2017  and  2018).  With  the  manufacturing \nrecession now under way, 2020 will be no exception. Forecasts from early this year \nwill  be  revised  downward.  Leading  indicators  based  on  the  ISM  manufacturing \nindex, the performance of equities vs. bonds, dollar trends and industrial commodity \nprices support this view. The downward trend of P/Es since January 2018 began in \nanticipation of the ongoing global slowdown. The 2019 equity market rally should be \nregarded as a reversion of P/Es to their historical averages. Yet, earnings revisions for \nnext year could turn positive after a more challenging Q1, if the manufacturing outlook \nimproves. Better earnings, positive liquidity and low interest rates may support the \nequity markets, as far as the trade war does not intensify. A point of attention will be \napproaching US elections, when the market sentiment could become more fragile \nand dependent on polls.\n\n70\n\n65\n\n60\n\n55\n\n50\n\n45\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\nl\ne\nv\ne\nL\n \nx\ne\nd\nn\nI\n \n\nM\nS\nI\n\nWhen will it be the time to look beyond the valley?\nThe recession in manufacturing began in Asia, before spilling over to Europe and then \nthe United States. Pressure on global trade from US tariff hikes has held back global \ngrowth, despite the Chinese stimulus, and therefore curbed an economic recovery in \nEurope. It could end up impacting US consumers unless an agreement is reached in \nthe run-up to the US presidential elections. So, what might make us more constructive \nduring the year? Keep a close eye on when the Fed manages to regain control of \nthe  yield  curve  (re-steepening)  and  when  the  ISM  manufacturing  index  bottoms \nout. Moreover, the gap between the ISM manufacturing and services indices is also \nclose to its cyclical highs; either the manufacturing index begins to move back up, or \nservices will be impacted. \nThe  US  dollar,  which  has  been  strengthening,  often  reflects  this  divergence  rather \nwell  (with  services,  which  are  more  domestic  in  nature,  prevailing  for  now  over \nmanufacturing, which is more international in scope) and could well be “the” variable \nto keep track of in 2020. \nA weaker US dollar alongside a bottoming out in manufacturing, would encourage \ninvestors to raise the level of risk in their portfolios.\n\n14  For professional investors only \n\n-600\n\n-400\n\n-200\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n2\nY\ne\na\nr\n \nB\no\nn\nd\nY\ni\ne\nl\nd\n\n \n\n,\n \n\n \n\nY\no\nY\nb\np\ns\n \n(\ni\nn\nv\ne\nr\nt\ne\nd\n \ns\nc\na\nl\ne\n)\n\n1984 \n\n1989 \n\n1994 \n\n1999 \n\n2004 \n\n2009 \n\n2014 \n\n2019\n\n  ISM Manufacturing\u2003   US 2Y Bond Yield (YoY bps, lag 22M)\u2003   50 Threshold\n\nSource: Analysis by Amundi Research, Datastream. Data as of 15 October 2019. \n\nBetween caution and upside risk\nThe current phase is a cyclical slowdown. PMI manufacturing levels all over the world \nhave fallen below 50. Interest rates are receding, gold and the US dollar are rising, and \ncorporate earnings growth is fading. This could heighten risk aversion, with defensive \nstocks outperforming cyclical ones. During such phases, P/Es and earnings generally \ntrack each other downward for some time. This is a challenging phase, as it will be \nfollowed by another phase during which it will be time to be contrarian and switch \nback  to  those  assets  that  have  performed  the  worst.  It’s  never  easy  to  time  the \nmarket, and it would be wise to spread risk widely. \n\nInvestors should assess a possible bottoming out in earnings growth and be prepared \nto raise exposure to the most contrarian markets and sectors (the European, Japanese \nor emerging markets and the auto sector, for example) in the coming months and/or \nto exploit opportunities from dislocations.\n\n2020 INVESTMENT OUTLOOK\x0cFactor investing: Playing rotation of factors with ‘quality’ and ‘high dividends’\n\nThe minimum volatility factor best fits the current phase of the cycle. However, at the same time investors should be aware that the next stage of the cycle will require a U-turn \nin terms of positioning, should a bottoming out of manufacturing become concrete.\n\nInvestment convictions\n\nThe current stage of the cycle suggests some caution\nAfter raising interest rates one last time in December 2018 (once too many, it turns out), \nthe Fed had to keep them on hold for several months before beginning a downward \nphase in late July 2019. The Fed had a reason to call off its tightening cycle – growth \nwas becoming increasingly scarce. \n\nIt’s little wonder that growth stocks, which have outperformed value stocks since the \nGreat Financial Crisis, continued to do so at first. However, when the Fed lowers its \nrates, it also has a reason – that the risk of recession is rising. This has undermined the \ncase for growth stocks, which are overvalued compared to value stocks. But to truly \ntake advantage, value stocks still lack a major source of support, such as a rebound \nin long bond yields. \n\nThe  current  cyclical  slowdown,  therefore,  has  been  more  in  favour  of  what  is \ndefensive within both of these two opposing styles. In fact, the factor that generally \nprevails  during  such  phases  is  minimum  volatility.  This  is  hardly  surprising  during  a \nstage of the cycle in which psychology is taking precedence over fundamentals and \nin which the correlation of equities with other equities is increasing. The reflex is to \ntherefore seek protection.\n\nWhat will be the next phase?\nOnce the cyclical slowdown is over, it will be time to switch to the opposite of what \nworked  during  the  previous  phase,  meaning  it  will  be  time  to  be  contrarian  and \ninvest in oversold or high-beta stocks. \n\nAn upturn in the PMI will strengthen the case for small caps, while an upturn in bond \nyields will support value stocks – the combination of the two arguments will favour \ncyclicals.  The  usual  race  has  already  started  between  dovish  monetary  policies  and \nthe deterioration of economic indicators. We are currently on the silver line to turn to \nthis next stage.\n\nWhile the positioning entering 2020 has to be balanced keep in mind that a defensive \nportfolio  would  incur  an  upside  risk  and  that  the  transition  to  the  next  phase  will \nultimately be the strongest disruption of the cycle in factor terms. \n\n0.75\n\n0.65\n\n0.55\n\n0.45\n\n0.35\n\n0.25\n\n0.15\n\nMinimum volatility and alternative choices\nThe  minimum  volatility  style  best  fits  this  phase  of  the  cycle.  However,  at  the  same \ntime, managing the upside risk is also key. One way to do both then is to combine \nhigh dividends with quality. \nThis makes it possible to limit, for the moment, excess exposure to financials, a sector \nthat  is  being  penalised,  all  at  once,  by  interest  rate  cuts,  disruption  and  regulation \n(at least in Europe); indeed, high dividend strategies overweight financials, while the \nquality factor underweights it. \nCombining these two factors also makes it possible to avoid frontal exposure to the \nvalue and growth styles, while overweighting quality to growth and high dividends to \npure value. In this case, the next step will consist of increasing high dividends at the \nexpense of quality.\n\nInvestors  should  consider  entering  2020  with  a  balanced  stance,  playing  the \nminimum volatility factor, quality and high dividends, and be prepared to increase \nhigh dividends, value and even small caps.\n\nCorrelation of S&P500 constituents with the S&P500\n\nHigh correlation\n\nAverage\n\nLow correlation\n\n4\n7\n9\n1\n\n9\n7\n9\n1\n\n4\n8\n9\n1\n\n9\n8\n9\n1\n\n4\n9\n9\n1\n\n9\n9\n9\n1\n\n4\n0\n0\n2\n\n9\n0\n0\n2\n\n4\n1\n0\n2\n\n9\n1\n0\n2\n\n  Average correlation of S&P500 constituents with the S&P500\u2003   Average\n\nSource: Analysis by Amundi Research, Datastream.

The search for yield in developed markets, both through spread  \n(mainly in Europe) and duration (more in the US) is likely to remain in 2020 and to offer some opportunities in the low yield for longer global environment.\n\nInvestment convictions\n\nGlobal easing to continue, supporting bond markets, with \nsome\xa0volatility\nCyclical drivers and structural forces are likely to remain at work next year, supporting \nbond markets. The macro picture sees persisting downward risks in a mature cycle, \nwith  limited  inflationary  pressures,  presenting  an  ideal  environment  for  more  global \neasing from central banks and possible fiscal accommodation. Debt levels at all-time \nhighs and the need to avoid an unwanted tightening in financial conditions are other \nfactors behind the need to keep yields below nominal growth. In the short term, too \nmuch is expected from policy measures and this could trigger some volatility. However, \nthere  is  a  clear  trend  towards  further  easing,  a  trend  which  will  become  even  more \nobvious when we will get closer to a more effective risk of recession. The credit cycle \nwill  likely  extend  further,  in  an  overall  more  fragile  environment,  with  falling  market \nliquidity. The optimised search for yield will go ahead, with increasing caution. \n\nOur convictions: focus on quality and liquidity\nFor govies, we maintain a preference for US Treasuries vs. other developed markets, \non  better  absolute  and  relative  valuations  and  more  leeway  at  the  Fed’s  disposal  in \nterms  of  conventional  tools.  In  the  Eurozone,  our  preference  stays  with  periphery \nvs.  core,  with  Italian  bonds  closer  to  other  BBB-rated  instruments  in  the  short-  to \nmedium-term  segments,  but  still  offering  some  premium  in  the  long-term  segment \nof  the  curve.  Yield  curve  flattening  could  offer  opportunities  to  investors  as  well  as \ninflation-linked bonds. In credit markets, within the current “tug of war” between the \nweakening macro/micro picture on one side and supportive technical factors on the \nother, the latter still look stronger. This is the case especially for EUR denominated \ncorporate bonds: the rationale for these are fresh purchases, together with substantial \nreinvestments, from the ECB, steady investment flows into IG dedicated products, the \nquite limited supply of new speculative grade debt and the intensified search for yield \ntargeting the few remaining spread oases. US credit markets are also supported by \nfavourable technicals, but not to the same extent.\n\nSustainability  and  quality  should  be  the  key  drivers  of  selection  and  portfolio \nconstruction now, as fundamentals have already started to deteriorate.\n\nCSPP = corporate sector purchase programme.\n\n \n\ni\n\nt\nb\ne\nd\ng\nn\nd\nn\na\nt\ns\nt\nu\no\n \nf\no\ne\nr\na\nh\nS\n\n \n\n30%\n\n25%\n\n20%\n\n15%\n\n10%\n\n  5%\n\n  0%\n\n16  For professional investors only \n\nLeverage ratios and credit metrics, along with valuations, are also generally in favour \nof the Old Continent. Our preference still goes therefore to European credit markets \nand in particular, to instruments BBB-BB rated: within the IG segment BBBs offer more \nattractive  valuations  than  higher  rated  issues,  while  in  HY  territory,  high  quality  and \nmore  liquid  BB-rated  debt  offers  a  more  attractive  risk  reward  combination,  given \nhigher  downside  risks  to  the  macro  picture.  Current  trends  show  that  global  HY \ndefaults are still low, mostly concentrated in the US, and are an energy/low-rated story: \nfinancial leading indicators point to higher defaults in one year’s time, both in the US \nand in Europe, but that levels will still be below long-term averages. \n\nIn search of remaining yield, but targeting higher quality \nThe risks of an alternative scenario pointing to higher default rates increased on the \nback  of  the  recent  weakening  macro  picture  and  the  persisting  uncertainties  linked \nto  geopolitical risk. Therefore, we keep  our preference for higher quality among HY \nnames, even in this yield-hunting world, together with our preference for securitised \ncredit in the US market.

Emerging equities could still deliver a positive performance, but selectivity is key. EM \nbonds are a natural choice in the current environment of low yields in developed markets. \n\nMore constructive growth outlook for 2020\nThe emerging markets outlook for growth in 2020 is more constructive than in 2019: \nsome acceleration in the first half of the year will be followed by a stabilisation moving \ntowards the end of 2020. Overall, the inflation outlook remains benign and inflation \nlevels  within  the  CBs’  ranges,  however,  some  base  effect  kicking  in,  together  with \nearly signals of tariff-related costs, would move inflation higher. 2019’s incrementally \neasier  monetary  stance  will  reduce  in  scope  (but  in  countries  patently  behind  the \ncurve like Mexico) and China will maintain a gradual approach able to accommodate \nits slowdown. Fiscal policy is expected to be moderately supportive: the several 2020 \nbudget  laws  so  far  announced  and  delivered  point  to  the  need  to  seek  economic \nsupport, keeping as much fiscal prudence as possible. \n\nIn  a  generally  dovish  environment  in  terms  of  DM  CBs,  countries’  external \nvulnerabilities shouldn’t pose systemic challenges.\n\nEM equity: focus on resilient domestic stories\nGlobal  emerging  markets  (GEM)  aggregate  valuations  are  close  to  neutrality.  The \nundervaluation  that  we  observed  one  year  ago  in  terms  of  cyclically  adjusted  PE \nhas disappeared and now GEM is fairly valued, with limited upside on the 12-month \nhorizon. Deceleration in GEM YoY EPS has been taking place since the beginning of \n2018 and growth became negative in Q1 2019. Some good news came from revisions, \nwhich  were  still  negative  but  signaled  some  bottoming  out.  Internal  MSCI  EM  EPS \nforecasts (USD) show a gradual recovery in 2020, when growth will become positive \nagain, even if low single digit. \n\nThis bottoming out signal is quite evident and in line with the scenario we have for \nEM exports and world trade. The environment described here is in line with further \nextension of the cycle. The change can be abrupt and needs to be closely monitored; \nin particular, it’s important to be ready to move from quality to value factor (mainly \ndeep value). We favour some inexpensive EMEA countries with good dividend yield \nprospects and low investors’ positioning. \n\nIn  Asia  we  keep  a  preference  for  India,  other  structural  domestic  stories  with \npositive  macro  momentum  and  for  Chinese  A-shares  (which  should  benefit  from \ndomestic supportive policies).\n\nEM fixed income: A natural candidate in the hunt for yield\nThe outlook for EM bonds remains positive. This asset class could become a natural \nchoice in the current environment of low yields and global monetary policy easing as \na way to sustain economic growth. The EM-DM GDP gap is expected to widen further \nin favour of EM:\n�  EM bonds in local currency: we are constructive on this asset class as real yields are \nexpected to decrease to 1.8% on the 12-month horizon (GBI diversified weighted), \nbut to remain higher than DM. \n\n�  EM currencies is the asset class that mostly discounts the nervousness on global \ngrowth and it therefore will remain volatile. We expect a quite neutral contribution, \nGBI weighted, of EM FX to the total return of the asset class. \n\n�  EM  bonds  in  hard  currency,  on  the  other  hand,  are  a  bit  expensive.  The  EMBI \ndiversified  spread  tightened  strongly  in  2019,  thanks  partly  to  the  changes  in  its \ncomposition (GCC inclusion and Venezuela exclusion). The strong dollar has been \nanother  factor  contributing  to  the  double-digit  performance  of  HC  bonds  YTD. \nExpectations for 2020 are for a EMBI diversified spread widening of about 30 bps, \nfrom  current  stretched  levels,  and  also  that  the  support  coming  from  the  strong \nUSD should fade away. Issuances continue to be quite high. \n\n�  EM corporate bonds: in the corporate space, EM HY defaults have recently been \nlow compared with what current market conditions would imply. The percentage \nof defaults expected for the next year remains quite contained.\n\nEmerging markets continue to be a key area for investors to search for income (both \nin  equity  and  bonds)  and  for  growth  opportunities.  For  2020,  the  focus  should \nbe  on  more  autonomous  themes  such  as  “help  yourself”  countries  and  on  longer \nperspective structural themes such as the New Silk Road.\n\n17  For professional investors only \n\n2020 INVESTMENT OUTLOOK\x0cCommodities: Benign outlook amid a mild rebound of global trade in sight\n\nThe outlook is moderately positive for commodities, assuming a mild rebound in global trade. Oil should move higher notwithstanding resilient US shale oil production, while \ndovish central banks and low real rates will support gold.\n\nInvestment convictions\n\nOil: less sensitive to geopolitical risk, thanks to US production\nDespite idiosyncratic risks and geopolitical tensions in Middle East, global demand, \nUS  oil  production  and  OPEC  strategy  will  be  the  key  drivers  for  2020.  Uncertainty \nover global demand abounds for several good reasons. \n\nThe  trade  war  escalation  has  exacerbated  downside  risks  to  the  overall  economic \npicture slowdown, while China’s transition to a new economic growth model and GDP \ndeceleration is weighing on global oil demand. On top of that, US oil production has \nproven very resilient and oil seems less vulnerable than in the past to supply disruption \nconcerns. Recent events in the Middle East (Iran’s oil exports slide after US sanctions \nand the attack on ARAMCO production) did not structurally affect energy prices. \n\nCrude oil looks less sensitive to geopolitical risks due to the unprecedented jump \nin  US  production.  The  US  has  steadily  become  a  net  exporter  this  year,  eroding  a \nsignificant OPEC production share. Therefore, US shale oil production will remain the \nlong-term  crucial  factor  and  will  affect  OPEC  decisions  in  2020.  We  maintain  our \ntarget  range  of  $55-$65  for  WTI  and  $60-$70  for  Brent,  even  if  we  acknowledge \nthe risks are skewed to the downside due to global oil demand cooling and sluggish \nChinese growth.\n\nBase metals should benefit from a rebound of PMI and global trade \nin 2020\n2019  has  been  a  troubled  year  for  base  metals  due  to  the  global  manufacturing \nrecession,  the  trade  war  escalation  and  the  US  dollar  appreciation  that  occurred \nin  the  first  half  of  the  year.  Low  Purchasing  Manager  Indices  and  disappointing \neconomic  figures  depressed  demand  for  base  metals,  putting  downward  pressure \non  commodities  prices.  Despite  a  synchronised  stabilization  being  the  most \nlikely  outcome  for  2020,  we  remain  constructive  on  base  metals  as  we  think  the \nmanufacturing  sector  could  stabilise  thanks  to  a  mild  rebound  in  world  trade. \nIn  addition,  financial  conditions  should  be  supportive  as  the  US  dollar  is  expected \nto  marginally  depreciate  and  interest  rates  to  remain  low.  The  biggest  risks  to  our \nscenario are global trade failing to rebound and a further trade war escalation: in such \na scenario, all of the risky/cyclical asset classes will correct significantly.\n\ne\nc\ni\nr\np\nd\no\nG\n\nl\n\n \n\n2000\n\n1800\n\n1600\n\n1400\n\n1200\n\n1000\n\n  800\n\n18  For professional investors only \n\nEasing central banks and economic uncertainty remain positive \nfor\xa0gold \nGold  benefited  from  a  dramatic  change  in  central  banks’  monetary  policies  during \n2019. The gold rally has been driven by economic uncertainty, increasing geopolitical \ntensions  and  a  sharp  fall  in  US  real  rates  expectations. We  remain  constructive  on \ngold in 2020 as we think all three of these drivers will also underpin precious metals. \nCentral  banks’  active  management  of  balance  sheets  is  clearly  another  important \nfactor and will likely play a similar role as it did in 2010-2011. The risk scenario for gold \nis  related  to  economic  growth  rebound,  should  global  manufacturing  stabilise  or \nrecover. In addition, a trade deal and short-term relief in risk sentiment could reduce \nappetite  for  safe-haven  assets.  On  the  other  hand,  economic  growth  is  not  strong \nenough to boost weak physical demand for the yellow metal.\n\nIf, as we believe, the global recession will be averted, the outlook for commodities \nremains  benign.

A turn in investor sentiment due to a policy surprise (fiscal boost/trade deal) would undermine USD strength.\n\nUSD: Lack of alternatives in the short term to balance USD’s \nnegative factors\nWe enter 2020 with a global weak economic outlook with possible stabilisation in sight,  \nstill  accomodative  central  banks  and  high  political  uncertainty  that  is  weighing  on \ntrade, capex spending and thus on manufacturing activity. The still contained recession \nprobability, diminishing rates advantage and expectations of US growth convergence \ntowards  rest  of  the  world  levels  would  imply  a  substantial  depreciation  of  the \novervalued USD, but we do not think that there will be a full convergence towards fair \nvalue. We expect the greenback to trade lower on the 12-month horizon, but we are \nstill  questioning  the  magnitude  of  such  movement.  In  our  view,  in  fact,  the  US  yield \nadvantage remains high and our baseline scenario is missing a potential catalyst that \nwould imply a consistent USD sell-off. We expect fiscal stimulus out of the US to be \nimplemented only in response to a further deterioration in economic activity and thus, \nto be seen as a mere substitute for monetary policy, with difficulties to push inflation \nexpectations higher. The less negative newsflow on US-China will be short-lived as we \ndo not expect any meaningful deal to be signed between the two parties and, although \nwe are aware that the US administration aims to obtain a weaker USD, we do not foresee \nany direct intervention from either the Fed or the US Treasury. \n\nWith  this  backdrop  and  concerns  on  global  growth  expected  to  stay,  we  believe \nUSD  depreciation  is  the  most  likely  outcome,  but  the  movement  will  be  limited. \nAlternative scenarios need to materialise to see investors definitely closing USD longs \n– flight to quality to dissipate, policy mix to spur growth outside of the US and the \nUSD carry trade to vanish on the back of a more aggressive Fed. It is also true that we \nexpect the Fed to cut more aggressively only in response to further economic activity \ndeterioration (risk scenario), an environment where the USD would remain resilient as \nits safe haven status is going to be predominant. \n\nThe upside scenario (with concerns on growth dissipating) needs to materialise or \nthe  US-China  trade  dispute  to  soften  (with  CNY  rallying)  to  see  a  sustained  USD \nplunge. In that case, the era of “King USD” will finally end.\n\n�  EURUSD bullish case remains unlikely at this stage. With Europe leading the global \ncyclical  slowdown,  several  unknowns  related  to  politics  and  the  rates  differential \nexpected to remain high, we struggle to see EURUSD reversing entirely the 2019 \ntrend. An appreciation is expected, but growth is what we need to see investors \nturning  structurally  positive  on  the  undervalued  single  currency.  The  issue  is \nthat we could be close to the point where policy mix (fiscal/monetary) is the only \navailable option, but things have to get worse before getting better and, as a result, \nwe expect the EURUSD appreciation to be limited. \n\n�  GBPUSD:  some  relief,  but  limited  upside.  With  risks  of  no  deal  having  reduced \nsignificantly,  part  of  the  political  premium  that  weighed  on  the  GBP  should  be \ntaken off and we see no urgent need for the BoE to cut rates. On the other hand, \nthere are many unknowns on future Brexit steps and UK domestic conditions have \ncollapsed in line with the global picture. We remain positive on the currency, which \nis undervalued by more than 16% vs. fundamentals, but we believe the upside will \nbe limited. GBPUSD targeted at 1.31 for the next 12 months. \n\n�  USDJPY to keep trending lower in 2020. JPY remains supported in an environment \nthat  is  still  questioning  the  extent  of  the  current  slowdown  in  global  growth.  \nThe  currency  is  undervalued  vs.  fundamentals  and  recently  under-reacted  vs.  a \nbasket of risk sensitive assets and should be the perfect hedge in a low conviction \nworld. We see USDJPY at 104 and EURJPY at 118 for the next 12 months.\n\n�  EM  FX:  neutral  stance  with  selective  opportunities  We  adopt  a  neutral  stance \non  EM  currencies  for  2020.  Aggressive  rate  cuts  from  the  EM  CBs  (expected  in \nsome countries) could reduce high carry currencies’ attractiveness. CNY is going \nto move in a range of 7.10-7.20. Selectivity remains key.\n\nGlobally the trend is towards politicisation of monetary variables with (geo)political \nfactors becoming a key driver in currency dynamics.\n\n19  For professional investors only \n\n2020 INVESTMENT OUTLOOK\x0cPrivate markets in Europe: The search for illiquidity premium is set to continue\n\nAgainst a backdrop of low interest rates, sluggish economic growth and political uncertainties, Europe’s private assets industry is in strong health. This attractiveness relative \nto listed assets is set to continue, with investors looking for an alternative premium, in addition to potentially enhanced income returns and diversification. \n\nInvestment convictions\n\nIn a world of low to negative interest rates and low growth, investors continue to adjust \ntheir allocations in pursuit of higher returns to serve their long-term liabilities and are \ntherefore increasingly considering private markets and real assets due to their illiquidity \npremium, but also stable returns. The scale of the European alternative assets industry \nitself  is  already  quite  remarkable,  with  €1.67tn,  ranking  second  only  to  the  US,  and \nup €310bn over the last three years, according to Preqin.  All the evidence points to \nEurope being fully equipped and ready to participate in the near-doubling of global \nalternatives  AUM  that  Preqin  forecasts  for  the  next  four  years,  at  $14tn.  However, \ninvestors should be aware that crises and corrections exist in the alternative world and \nthat  the  choice  of  private  markets  and  real  assets  should  be,  first  of  all,  a  long-term \nstrategic  decision  that  is  made  not  only  on  the  basis  of  their  absolute  performance. \nIn  fact,  these  asset  classes  demonstrate  different  investment  features  that  can \nhelp  investors  to  enhancing  their  overall  portfolio  diversification  and  robustness \nthroughout the various phases of the economic cycle.\n\nReal estate (RE)\nThe low 10y government bond return expectations have paved the way for some further \nyet moderate yield compression in some office and logistic submarkets, as the gap with \nprime yields is, at this stage, significantly higher than the long-term average for many \nasset classes. The recent rise in prime retail yields – especially shopping centres – in \nsome countries has to be closely monitored as it can negatively affect capital values. \n\nAlternative asset class profiles\n\nParticipation \nin Economic \nGrowth\n\nGeneration \nof Stable \nRevenues\n\nProtection \nagainst \ncertain risks\n\nControl \nof Asset\n\nIlliquidity \nPremium\n\nDecorrelation \nvs Listed \nAssets\n\nAsset Class\n\nPrivate \nEquity\n\nStrong\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nReal Estate\n\nSignificant  Significant Moderate\n\nModerate\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nInfrastructure\n\nSignificant\n\nModerate\n\nModerate\n\nPrivate Debt\n\nStrong \n\nSignificant\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nSource: Amundi.

For illustrative purpose.\n\nHedge Funds Moderate\n\nModerate\n\nModerate Moderate\n\nModerate\n\n20  For professional investors only \n\nIn our central scenario, rental growth in logistics and offices could remain a key factor \nof growth in capital values in 2020, due to the lack of vacancies in some submarkets. \nAs always, active management of the assets remains a key driver of performance.\n\nPrivate debt (PD)\nPersisting low to negative rates in Europe create massive investment challenges for \ninstitutional  investors.  For  investors,  PD  is  an  attractive  complement  to  traditional \nfixed income and offers predictable  returns, a relative decorrelation to other asset \nclasses,  low  volatility  and  diversification  –  as  PD  investing  is  not  done  in  the  same \ncredits/issuers  as  on  public  markets.  PD  has  therefore  been  in  strong  demand  in \nEurope  over  the  last  few  years  and  this  excess  of  liquidity  has  led  to  inflated  asset \nprices, a loosening of credit protections and legal guarantees and more aggressive \nstructuring  for  certain  market  segments.  The  risks  of  refinancing  have  therefore \nincreased  in  certain  PD  segments  and  could  lead  to  a  future  spike  in  the  level  of \ndefault rate, especially if the event of a credit cycle downturn. All of this commands \nto  focus  on  the  top  of  the  capital  structure,  the  traditional  senior  debt  segment, \nwhile avoiding sophisticated engineered structures which can reintroduce credit risk \nthrough  contractual  subordination.  The  quality  and  depth  of  sourcing  to  maintain \nhigh selectivity, as well as the analysis of both risk and structure of transactions are \nmore necessary than ever as key components of a sound investment strategy in PD.\n\nPrivate equity (PE)\nDespite some concerns on rising valuations and high levels of dry power, PE remains \nattractive  and  should  continue  to  outperform  relative  to  other  asset  classes  also \naffected by high valuations. In order to continue to outperform, PE investors will have \nto rely on a combination of choices of conviction, real levers to influence companies' \nstrategy,  long-term  approach  to  support  corporate  growth,  and  focus  on  a  limited \nnumber  of  deals.  To  invest  well  in  PE,  a  long-term  strategy  must  be  resolutely \nimplemented  in  a  consistent  manner  over  time.  Finally,  it  is  important  to  consider \nthat when the economic cycle downturns, small caps are more vulnerable than large \ncaps. In contrast, large caps are more closely correlated to listed markets and more \ndependent on IPOs to organize exits. \n\n2020 INVESTMENT OUTLOOK\x0cCross-asset: Playing a sentiment rebound, in an overall cautious stance\n\nLate cycle is our central case: bull market, to be sustainable, needs economic and profits re-acceleration. Financial conditions will also be crucial next year. Tactically moderate \noverweight in global equities and IG credit due to tentative signs of a rebound in investors’ confidence and still supportive relative values considerations.\n\nInvestment convictions\n\nThe overall picture is still moderately in favour of risky assets, despite some financial \nstress in the currency space and downward earnings revisions. In fact, US resilience \nand sustainable multiples continue to support risk taking.\n\nIn  our  view,  the  credit  inflection  point  (negative)  or  earnings  re-acceleration \n(positive) are the two factors that will drive the bifurcation in the outlook for risk \nassets that could appear during 2020.\n\nGlobal composite economic momentum set to rebound in 2020, tactically \nsupporting risk assets \n\nEconomic backdrop and valuation: timid signs of economic \nstabilisation\nOur central case is still for late cycle, despite the fact that the tail risk of a “correction \nphase” has increased significantly to around 30% (see Table on page 5). Global profits \n(including EM) are expected to grow below the historical average at 4%. While global \nGDP is expected to move close to potential, overall economic sentiment looks fragile. \nGeopolitics related to the trade war escalation has been the single biggest driver of \nthe slide in business confidence and global manufacturing PMI. Nevertheless, the most \nrecent data are confirming tentative signs of stabilisation and rebound. According to \nthe projections in our Global Economic Momentum Index, this trend should improve \nfurther in case of a trade deal announcement, helping markets to consolidate in 2020. \nA tactical upside and sector rotation from defensive to cyclical are also confirmed, \non the back of relative value considerations. However, in order to have a structural \nrisk  rerating,  soft  data  must  translate  into  a  well-spread  economic  rebound  and \nmanufacturing  stabilisation  in  the  next  months.  The  asset  allocation  stance  should \nremain strategically cautious to begin the year, with a tactical and moderate positive \nview  on  equity  and  high  quality  credit.  Low  rates  and  dovish  central  banks  favour \nlong duration positions, while gold remains a relatively cheap hedge in an uncertain \nenvironment.  The  US  and  EM  could  be  seen  as  preferred  regions  in  global  equities \ngoing forward, as momentum looks stronger compared with Japan and the Eurozone \n(no  sign  of  stabilisation  in  German  manufacturing  so  far),  and  both  should  benefit \nfrom the USD’s mild depreciation. This could change in case of a fiscal boost in the \nEurozone, amid falling geopolitical risk. In credit, Euro IG is preferable to US, due to \nhigh US leverage.\n\nSeeking catalysts for directional calls and sector rotation\nA lack of visibility on growth, geopolitical tensions and pivotal political events such as \nthe 2020 US presidential election act to prevent strategically loading risk. On the other \nhand, relative value consideration still provides a solid, although tactical, argument in \nfavour of global equities. This tug of war cannot last for long and the approach must \nbe flexible and agnostic. We think the catalysts for the current regime shift rely on \nfinancial conditions tracked by cross-asset sentinels (trade-weighted dollar, earnings \nrevisions, credit spread, credit-adjusted multiples). \n\n21  For professional investors only \n\nThe Global Economic Momentum index is an Amundi proprietary indicator based on four regional baskets (US, Eurozone, Japan and EM) and \non the following variables: earnings revisions, 10Y interest rates, leading indicators, CPI YoY, PMI surveys, the Economic Surprise Index and the \nInflation Surprise Index. We consider the level and the momentum (variation) of the index in order to define four economic cycles: Booming: \nuptrend level and positive momentum; Deteriorating: uptrend level and negative momentum; Weakness: downtrend level and negative \nmomentum; Improving: downtrend level and positive momentum.\nSource: Analysis by Amundi Research, Bloomberg. Data as of 31 October 2019.\n\n2020 INVESTMENT OUTLOOK\x0cESG-Fundamental: The ESG way to reinvent fundamental investing\n\nMany investors have already explored ESG investing by applying some scoring system into their investment portfolio or tracking some ESG benchmarks. For 2020 we think \ninvestors will go deeper in their adoption of ESG investing, and will start to look at ways of combining ESG and active investing.\n\nESG FOCUS\n\nIntegrating ESG and fundamental analysis\nESG investing by definition involves some active choices as it is about applying some \ndeviations from traditional capitalisation weighted indices to improve the ESG profile of \nthe portfolio. In our view, an integrated approach that combines fundamental and ESG \nanalysis (ESG-fundamental) can help improve risk-adjusted returns. This relies on the \nability to incorporate some of the ESG factors that can drive superior long-term returns \nand focus on the ones that can help mitigate risks. \n\nChallenges and opportunities\nThe  challenge  is  related  to  the  ability  to  “define  and  measure”  the  outcome  of  the \nintegration of ESG for risk-adjusted performance (on top of the pure ESG impact), as \nthis cannot easily be quantified. The opportunity lies in the fact that many ESG factors \nare  not  yet  well  remunerated  in  the  market  and  their  drivers  (regulations,  investor \nawareness, social habits…) change. \n\nAn adaptive process driven by changes in ESG market features\nTherefore,  the  ESG-fundamental  approach  is  an  adaptive  price  discovery  process. \nThrough inefficiencies and feedback loops, it evolves in order to detect the areas that \nare becoming more material in terms of financial performance. Risks related to climate \nchange are a case in point. Ten years ago, investors didn’t take into consideration these \nfactors, which later became material when increasing regulation and awareness of the \nclimate issues led investors to consider them in their portfolios. \n\nThe broad adoption of ESG investing is likely having an impact on asset class prices.\n\nIn  equities,  our  studies  show  that  ESG  investing  was  not  providing  added  value \nin  the  2010-2013  period;  it  has  started  to  become  material  regarding  stock \nprices  over  the  last  five  years,  with  different  nuances  across  regions  and  types  of \nportfolios  and  the  impact  of  the  three  components  (E,  S  and  G)  varies  over  time.  \nIn fixed income, there is little evidence of the benefits of ESG on alpha generation, but \na  strong  intuition  that  long-term  returns  can  only  benefit  from  ESG  integration  (i.e., \nsustainability of business models).\n\n  5%\n\n  4%\n\n  3%\n\n  2%\n\n  1%\n\n  0%\n\n-1%\n\n-2%\n\n-3%\n\n22  For professional investors only \n\nExploiting ESG opportunities by trimming from an evolving \nlandscape\n1.  Active  managers  can  take  advantage  of  discrepancies  in  the  scoring  systems \nand market inefficiencies. They should seek to make simple and explainable ESG \nassessments  and  go  in-depth  with  regard  to  understanding  where  the  real  ESG \nrisks are and how the market is pricing them. \n\n2.  ESG  scoring  only  provides  a  static  picture  and  it  fails  to  address  “WHY”  the \ncompany has a certain rating. Instead, most of the value asset managers can exploit \nis forward-looking. This is about detecting how the ESG profile of a company will \nevolve and the criteria that can lead to a potential improvement.\n\n3.  Engagement  is  key.  Speaking  with  companies,  knowing  them,  influencing  them \nto move towards the necessary changes to improve their ESG profile is what can \nadd value to an investment case and drive impact on areas that matter the most. \nEmbracing  an  ESG-fundamental  integrated  approach  means  that  asset  managers \ncannot  apply  it  only  in  few  funds,  this  has  to  be  a  100%  ambition.  The  advantage \nis  that  active  management  and  ESG  are  a  perfect  match  for  targeting  both  risk-\nadjusted performances and impact on the economy and society.\n\nLong best ESG & short worst ESG strategy – evolving benefits \n\nNorth America\n\nEMU\n\n10%\n\n  8%\n\n  6%\n\n  4%\n\n  2%\n\n  0%\n\n-2%\n\nE \n\nS \n\nG \n\nESG\n\nE \n\nS \n\nG \n\nESG\n\n  2010-2013\u2003   2014-2017\u2003   2018-H12019\n\n  2010-2013\u2003   2014-2017\u2003   2018-H12019\nSource: Analysis by Amundi Research.

tremors: risks, \nopportunities and the road ahead \n \n\n \n\n \n\nS\nK\nL\nA\nT\nT\nN\nE\nM\nT\nS\nE\nV\nN\n\nI\n\n \n \n \n \n\uf0a7  Economy: soft landing and light policy support. In terms of Chinese growth, we see the \nrate continuing to slow. Chinese GDP growth rose 6.0% in the third quarter of 2019 (Chinese \nauthorities forecasted a range of 6.0%-6.5% YoY), the slowest pace since the early 1990s. \nMoving into 2020, we do expect that the new growth target will be set around 6.0%, if not \nlower, at between 5.5% and 6.0%, and our current forecast is confirmed at 5.8% YoY. Exports \nunsurprisingly have been weak, private capex has slowed notably, and public infrastructure \nhas  not  picked  up  as  expected.  Going  forward,  we  expect  public  infrastructure  capex  to \naccelerate, and the tight real estate policy stance to potentially moderate. Chinese policy mix \nremains  stimulative,  though  in  a  very  limited  way  so  far  and  far  away  from  the  massive \nstimulus implemented in recent years. \nInvestment  implications.  Overall,  we  are  moderately  constructive  on  the  China’s  equity \nmarket. We see valuations as being supportive, though the earnings growth outlook appears \nmuted.  We  maintain  a  preference  for  A-shares  equities  that  are  more  exposed  to  the \ndomestic  Chinese  economy  that  benefit  from  the  MSCI  inclusion  process.  We  also  see \nopportunities in supply chain shifts (Taiwanese and Chinese tech) and in domestic brands \noffering increasingly more competitive products to international brands. \n\n\uf0a7  Asia region. We prefer to be selective and take advantage of the domestic stories that look \nto  be  able  to  deliver  some  fiscal  expansion.  We  are  still  constructive  on  India,  although \ndomestic  demand  remains  weak.  We  like  the  IT/software  sector,  where  companies  enjoy \nlarge cash flow yields and the best ones are willing to pay higher dividends. \n\n\uf0a7 \n\n\uf0a7  EM  fixed  income.  We  remain  slightly  positive  on  EM  fixed  income.  We  believe  that  this \nenvironment  of  still  very  loose  monetary  policy  globally  will  continue  to  favour  emerging \nmarkets bonds, including Asian bonds. In Asia, we are particularly positive on Indonesia and \nChina duration. \n\n \n \nWhat is your assessment of economic outlook for China? \nThe  economic  outlook  for  China  has  deteriorated  significantly  over  this  year.  China’s  GDP \ngrowth rose 6.0% in third-quarter 2019 (Chinese authorities had forecast a range of 6.0%-6.5% \nYoY), the slowest pace since the early 1990s, confirming annual average growth at just above \n6.0% (6.2% YoY). Moving into 2020, we expect that the new growth target will be set around \n6.0%, if not lower, at between 5.5% and 6.0%. Our current forecast is confirmed at 5.8% YoY.  \nThe performance of China’s economy continues to be at the hearth of the trade dispute with \nthe US and all the measures implemented have acted as a drag on growth. The contribution of \nnet exports has  continued  to be  positive  in 2019 as imports have declined much more than \nexports  (hit  by  tariffs).  Indeed,  the  external  shock  is  occurring  along  with  domestic  policies \naimed at deleveraging and higher regulation, and these factors continue to be issues while the \neconomy  is  under  threat  from  external  influences.  The  industrial,  consumer  and  property \nsectors  are  all  being  negatively  affected,  although  to  different  extents.  Fixed  assets \ninvestments have been struggling in the private and manufacturing sectors much more than in \nthe SOE and infrastructure. September figures show a decoupling between the two sectors. \nHousehold consumption, with the exception of auto sales, has decelerated only moderately. \nOverall,  a  much  stronger  slowdown  in  the  economy  is  likely  to  be  associated  with  a  further \nescalation in tariffs and extra-tariff measures, and also the lack of any appropriate intervention \nby the monetary and fiscal authorities, aimed at pursuing more structural objectives. That said, \nwe expect China to compromise more on the growth side to maintain its financial stability, but \nnot to the point of pushing the economy into a hard landing. \n \n\nVincent MORTIER \nDeputy CIO, Asia ex \nJapan Supervisor \n\n \n\nAlessia BERARDI \nDeputy Head of \nMacroeconomic Research \n\nAngelo CORBETTA \nHead of Asia Equity \n\nEsther LAW  \nPortfolio Manager \nEmerging Market Debt \n\nWith the contribution of: \nDebora Delbo’ \nSenior Strategist \nNicholas McConway \nPortfolio Manager China \nEquity \n\nDiscussion Paper I CROSS ASSET Investment Strategy\n\nINVESTMENT INSIGHTS BLUE PAPER | Q4 2019\n\nDP-41-2019\nBuybacks – A multi-perspective \nreview and thoughts on best practices \nfor company buyback policies\n\nHigh Yield: deep diving needed \ndue to a more uncertain outlook\n\n1   \n\n \n\nDocument for the exclusive attention of professional clients, investment services providers and any other professional of the financial industry\n\nChina’s growth tremors: risks, opportunities  \nand the road ahead\n\nBuybacks – A multi-perspective review and \nthoughts on best practices for company  \nbuyback policies\n\nHigh Yield: deep diving needed due to a more \nuncertain outlook\n\nDiscover Amundi investment insights at\nresearch-center.amundi.com\n\n26  For professional investors only \n\n2020 INVESTMENT OUTLOOK\x0cDiscliamer\n\nThe MSCI information may only be used for your internal use, may not be reproduced or redisseminated in any form and may not be used as a basis for or a component of \nany financial instruments or products or indices.

Estimates and methodology subject to change and based on data as of December 31, \n2022. See main text above for methodology. For earnings yield, U.S. is based on S&P 500; U.K. on FTSE 100 Index; Eurozone is a cap-\nweighted average of large-cap indices in Germany, France, Italy, Netherlands and Spain; Japan is Topix Index; and “Emerging Markets” is MSCI \nEmerging Markets Index. For payout-based estimates, all countries are based on corresponding MSCI indices. “Global Developed” is a cap-\nweighted average. For emerging markets, payout-based estimate is dividend yield + forecast GDP per capita growth. Excess-of-cash return \nis calculated by subtracting real cash return estimates described later in the article. Hypothetical performance results have certain inherent \nlimitations, some of which are disclosed in the back. Estimates are for illustrative purposes only, are not a guarantee of performance and are \nsubject to change.

Not representative of any portfolio that AQR currently manages.\n\nSo which is correct? It seems plausible that \n\nand may incorporate survey data in our CMAs \n\nbond risk premia did increase in 2022, as \n\nin the future. Humility is warranted: all \n\ninflation and monetary policy uncertainty \n\nmethods for estimating time-varying expected \n\nraised perceptions of bonds as risky (and \nperhaps less diversifying27) assets.28 We \n\nreturns and risk premia involve debatable \n\nassumptions and wide bands of uncertainty. \n\ncontinue to evaluate market- and survey-based \n\nFor strategic investors, the positive long-term \n\napproaches to estimating market risk premia, \n\naverage premium is the prize.\n\n27  See Brixton et al. (2023), “A Changing Stock-Bond Correlation: Drivers and Implications.”\n28  Other estimates of bond risk premia show fluctuations but little net change during 2022; see the term structure models of Kim and \n\nWright, and Adrian et al.\n\n\x0c14 \n\nCapital Market Assumptions for Major Asset Classes  |  1Q23\n\nConcluding thoughts (and a word on liquidity)\n\nTo invest is to accept the risk of losses in pursuit of returns above the risk-free rate. A rise in the \n\nrisk-free rate could eventually make the investor’s task easier, by allowing them to attain a given \n\nreal or nominal return goal with less risk. But we are not there yet, because valuations of some \n\nrisky assets (and especially illiquid assets) have not adjusted to higher discount rates, so their \n\npremia appear compressed. \n\nLiquidity risk has been in the spotlight in recent months, with the gating of a large real estate \n\nfund in the U.S. and LDI stress triggering a dash for cash for some U.K. pension funds. Over \n\nthe past decade, many investors responded to low expected returns by accepting less liquidity \n\nin their portfolios. Illiquidity has conferred cosmetic benefits of price-smoothing and lagged \nreporting,29 which are conspicuously lacking in public markets and liquid alternatives where \n\nmark-to-market volatility has been high. But there can be costs to illiquidity too. These have \n\nmaterialized in the past (recall private asset firesales during the Global Financial Crisis), and \n\nthe current compressed premia are a hint that they may do so again. Allocations that are both \n\ndiversifying and liquid are likely to be particularly valuable for enhancing portfolio resilience in \n\nuncertain times.\n\n29  Investor preference for smooth returns may even offset any required illiquidity premia in private assets; see Ilmanen (2022).\n\n\x0c \n\nCapital Market Assumptions for Major Asset Classes  |  1Q23 \n\n15\n\nReferences\n\nAdrian, T., R.

Estimates are for illustrative purposes only, are not a guarantee \nof performance and are subject to change. Not representative of any portfolio that AQR currently manages.\n\nSources and Methodology for Long-Term Historical Expected Returns \n\nSources for historical equity and bond \nexpected returns are AQR, Robert Shiller’s \ndata library, Kozicki-Tinsley (2006), Federal \nReserve Bank of Philadelphia, Blue Chip \nEconomic Indicators, Consensus Economics \nand Morningstar. Prior to 1926, stocks are \nrepresented by a reconstruction of the S&P \n500 available on Robert Shiller’s website which \nuses dividends and earnings data from Cowles \nand associates, interpolated from annual data. \n\nAfter that, stocks are the S&P 500. Bonds are \nrepresented by long-dated Treasuries. The \nequity yield is a 50/50 mix of two measures: \n50% Shiller E/P * 1.075 and 50% Dividend/\nPrice + 1.5%. Scalars are used to account \nfor long term real Earnings Per Share (EPS) \nGrowth. Bond yield is 10-year real Treasury \nyield minus 10-year inflation forecast as in \nExpected Returns (Ilmanen, 2011), with no \nrolldown added.\n\nMethodology for Forecast Error Analysis (Exhibit 1)\n\nNot only are the return forecasts uncertain, \nbut also any measures of forecast uncertainty \nare debatable. Forecasting requires humility \nat many levels. We first produce historical \ntime series of yield-based estimates for U.S. \nequities and U.S. Treasuries using the method \ndescribed in the previous paragraph (analysis \nstarts in 1900, but we use data from 1870s \n\nonwards). We test their predictive power using \nquarterly overlapping 10-year periods since \n1900 and measure the distribution of errors. \nSee the 2018 edition for more details. Error \nranges in Exhibit 1 are based on interquartile \nranges of these distributions, adjusted for \ncurrent volatility estimates. \n\n\x0c \n\nCapital Market Assumptions for Major Asset Classes  |  1Q23 \n\n17\n\nDisclosures\n\nThis document has been provided to you solely for information purposes and does not constitute an offer or solicitation of an offer or \nany advice or recommendation to purchase any securities or other financial instruments and may not be construed as such.

IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL \nTRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING.

Each year, besides the \n\nupdated estimates, we provide additional analysis or \n\nother new material. This year’s article includes a \n\nsection discussing how to estimate earnings growth, \n\na crucial input for equity market expected returns.  \n\nOur estimates are intended to assist investors with \n\nsetting medium-term expectations. The frameworks \nwe present are backed by empirical evidence,1 but \n\nestimates are highly uncertain, and not intended for \n\nmarket timing. As one cautionary example, the error \n\nranges shown in Exhibit 1, based on historical \n\nAs usual, we present local real (inflation-adjusted) \n\nanalysis, suggest there is a 50% chance that realized \n\nannual compound rates of return for a horizon of 5 \n\nequity market returns over the next 10 years will \n\nto 10 years. Over such intermediate horizons, \n\nunder- or overshoot by more than 3% per annum. \n\nstarting valuations tend to be useful inputs. For \n\nmulti-decade forecast horizons their impact is \n\ndiluted, so theory and long-term historical averages \n\nmay matter more in judging expected returns (see \n\nlast year’s special topic). At shorter horizons, returns \n\nare largely unpredictable and any predictability has \n\nExpected real returns for bonds and cash rose \n\nsharply in 2022 and 2023 from all-time lows in 2021 \n\n(see Exhibit 2). By contrast, expected returns for \n\nequities have remained fairly constant, implying a \n\nworld of compressed risk premia at the start of 2025.  \n\nExhibit 2: Expected Real Returns for U.S. Asset Classes Dec 31, 2020 – Dec 31, 2024 \n\nn\nr\nu\ne\nR\n\nt\n\n \nl\n\na\ne\nR\n\n6%\n\n5%\n\n4%\n\n3%\n\n2%\n\n1%\n\n0%\n\n-1%\n\n-2%\n\nPublic Equity\n\nPrivate Equity\n\nReal Estate\n\nHY Bonds\n\nIG Bonds\n\nTreasuries\n\nTIPS\n\nCash\n\n \n\nJan-2020\n\nJan-2021\n\nJan-2022\n\nJan-2023\n\nJan-2024\n\nJan-2025\n\nSource: AQR; see Exhibits 3-8 for details.

The so-called rolling yield measures the \n\ncash returns are more relevant for making \n\nexpected return of a constant-maturity bond \n\ninternational allocation decisions, and for investors \n\nallocation assuming an unchanged yield curve.  For \n\nwith access to leverage. \n\nexample, a strategy of holding constant-maturity 10-\n\nyear U.S. Treasuries has an expected annual \n\n(nominal) return of 4.9%, given the starting yield of \n\n4.6% and expected capital gains of 0.3% from \n\nrolldown as the bonds age. Exhibit 4 shows current \n\nlocal rolling yields for six countries, converted to \n\nlocal real returns by subtracting a survey-based \n\nforecast of next 10-year inflation. This year we also \n\ninclude expected returns for U.S. and global \n\naggregate bond benchmarks. \n\nWe also show expected excess-of-cash returns, \n\nwhich are effectively the returns accessed by hedged \n\ninvestors irrespective of their base currency \n\n(assuming zero cross currency basis). While real \n\nDuring 2024 most estimates increased, adding to the \n\nprevious two years’ increases. Higher yields and \n\nimproved rolldown were the main contributors. All \n\nmajor markets now have a positive expected local \n\nreal return, with some offering 2–3% above expected \n\ninflation. Estimates of bond risk premia or excess-\n\nof-cash returns have also risen as yield curves \n\nsteepened.  \n\nAny adjustment to these expected returns boils \n\ndown to expected changes in the yield curve level or \n\nshape. Capital gains/losses due to falling/rising \n\nyields dominate returns over short horizons but are \n\nhard to predict, and matter less over longer \n\nhorizons. \n\nExhibit 4: Expected Local Returns for 10-Year Government Bonds as of December 31, 2024 \n\nY \n\nRR \n\nI \n\n    Y + RR - I \n\nNominal     \n\nRolldown \nReturn \n\n10-Year \nForecast \nInflation \n\nExpected \nLocal Real \nReturn \n\nU.S. 10-Year \n\nJapan 10-Year \n\nGermany 10-Year \n\nU.K. 10-Year \n\nAustralia 10-Year \n\nGlobal Dev. 10-Year \n\nGlobal Dev. ex U.S.  \n\nU.S. Aggregate \n\nGlobal Aggregate \n\nYield \n\n4.6% \n\n1.1% \n\n2.4% \n\n4.5% \n\n4.4% \n\n3.9% \n\n3.0% \n\n4.6% \n\n3.3% \n\n0.3% \n\n0.8% \n\n0.6% \n\n0.4% \n\n0.5% \n\n0.4% \n\n0.6% \n\n0.3% \n\n0.4% \n\n2.3% \n\n1.7% \n\n2.0% \n\n2.1% \n\n2.5% \n\n2.2% \n\n2.0% \n\n2.3% \n\n2.1% \n\n \n\n1yr \nChange \n\n+0.9% \n\n \n\nExcess-\nof-Cash \nReturn \n0.8% \n\n+0.3% \n\n1.1% \n\n+0.7% \n\n0.3% \n\n+1.1% \n\n0.7% \n\n+0.7% \n\n0.9% \n\n+0.8% \n\n0.8% \n\n+0.6% \n\n0.9% \n\n+0.5% \n\n1.1% \n\n+0.3% \n\n0.5% \n\n2.5% \n\n0.2% \n\n0.9% \n\n2.8% \n\n2.4% \n\n2.2% \n\n1.6% \n\n2.9% \n\n2.0% \n\nSource:  Bloomberg, Consensus Economics and AQR.

Our \n\ndeliver a substantially lower risk-adjusted return \n\nestimate of 5- to 10-year expected return is therefore \n\nthan a diversified basket over the long term. A gold \n\nsimply the long-run average return of an equal-\n\ninvestment, for example, has exhibited useful tail-\n\nweighted portfolio of commodity futures. This \n\nhedging properties historically, but it forgoes the \n\nconsiderable diversification found within the \nbroader asset class.8\n\nportfolio has earned about 3% geometric average \n\nexcess return over cash since 1877, and a similar \nreturn if measured since 1951.7 We add the U.S. real \n\ncash return to give an expected real return of 4.7%.  \n\n \n\n5 Consistent with Giesecke et al. (2011) and Ben Dor et al. (2021), who \nfind that over the long term, the average credit risk premium is roughly \nhalf the spread. ‘Bad selling’ refers to the practice of selling bonds that no \n\nlonger meet the rating or maturity criteria of the index. \n\n6 These terms, both related to volatility, are not as closely offsetting for \nbroad indices as they are for single bonds, due to diversification effects. \nBriefly, the convexity term estimates the impact of non-linearities \n\nassuming yields will change, while the variance drag term estimates the \n\nimpact of compounding effects assuming return volatility will be non-zero. \n\n7 For more details see the 2016 edition, Levine, Ooi, Richardson and \nSasseville (2018), and the AQR data library. \n\n8 From January 1975 to December 2024, an investment in gold futures \ndelivered around 1.4% p.a. compound real return, a little more than cash. \n\n \n\n\x0cAlternative Risk Premia \n\nAQR Alternative Thinking 2025 Issue 1: Capital Market Assumptions for Major Asset Classes 7 \n\nIt is difficult to apply a yield-based approach to \n\nfeasible when multiple factor themes are applied in \n\ndynamic strategies where holdings are constantly \n\nmultiple asset classes. At a target volatility of 10%, \n\nevolving. Below we state long-term assumptions for \n\nwhat we believe to be sustainable long-term premia, \nbacked by a broad range of empirical evidence.9  \n\nsuch a hypothetical portfolio would have an \nexpected return of 7-8% over cash.11, 12  Long/short \n\nimplementations are particularly interesting in the \n\nFactor-Tilted Long-Only Portfolios \n\nWe believe a hypothetical value-tilted, diversified \n\nlong-only equity portfolio that is carefully \n\nimplemented and reasonably priced may be \n\nassumed to have an expected return 0.5% higher \n\nthan the cap-weighted index, after fees, with 2-3% \n\ntracking error.  For an integrated multi-factor \n\nstrategy – which we assume to include balanced \n\nallocations to value, momentum and defensive \n\nthemes – we assume an expected net active return of \n\naround 1% at a similar tracking error.  Finally, we \n\nthink a defensive equity portfolio may be assumed to \n\nhave an expected return similar to that of the \n\nrelevant cap-weighted index but may achieve this \nwith lower volatility.10  These are long-term \n\nestimates – we discuss tactical considerations below. \n\nLong/Short Factor Premia Implemented \n\nStandalone or as “Portable Alpha”   \n\nAlternative risk premia strategies are typically \n\nimplemented as a long/short market-neutral \n\nportfolio across multiple asset classes. They can be \n\nscaled to different risk levels, so we focus on \n\nexpected Sharpe ratio (SR). The degree of \n\ndiversification is critical. One theme applied in one \n\nasset class might have an expected SR of 0.2-0.3. For \n\ncurrent environment for two reasons: \n\n•  “Cash-plus” returns: central bank began to cut \n\ninterest rates in 2024, but rates are likely to \n\nremain substantially higher than in the previous \n\ndecade. This directly benefits total returns for \n\nlong/short liquid alternatives with large cash \n\nholdings – a fact often underappreciated by \ninvestors.13  \n\n•  “Portable alpha” implementations: when \n\ncombined with market beta, long/short strategies \n\ncan be used as an alternative to traditional active \n\nmanagement. During episodes of higher market \n\nconcentration where most stocks have tiny index \n\nweights, the efficiency advantage of long/short \n\nstrategies over long-only tilts is probably larger \n\nthan normal.  \n\nCurrent Valuations \n\nAggregate valuations across multiple styles are near \n\nlong-term averages.

Our estimates \nare purely illustrative and do not represent any AQR product or strategy. \n\n11 Consistent with historical data, we assume low correlations between \nfactors to produce our Sharpe ratio range for a diversified combination of \nlong/short factors. As transaction costs depend on implementation and \nboth transaction costs and fees vary with target volatility, our estimates \nare based on a transaction-cost-optimized strategy targeting 10% \nvolatility with fees of 1 to 1.5%.

During the 30 years \n\nto June 2024, real EPS growth was above 4% p.a. in \n\nthe U.S., compared to around 2–3% for other \n\ndeveloped markets. Ten years ago, in the 2015 \n\nedition of this report, we assumed just 1.5% real EPS \n\ngrowth for the next 10 years, but the U.S. delivered \naround 4% during that period too.17 \n\nsmoothing to mitigate the (substantial) impact of \n\nstart- and endpoints. This metric hovered around \n\n1.5% for decades, and this was our previous \n\nassumption for long-term growth. But recent strong \n\ndata has lifted it to 1.8%, and this year we have \n\nrevised our assumption accordingly. Now, some of \n\nthe recent growth tailwinds may not be repeated. \n\nSmolyansky (2023) estimates that one-off reductions \n\nin corporate tax rates and interest rates explain \n\nnearly half of U.S. earnings growth from 1989 to \n\nHowever, despite these impressive fundamentals, \n\n2019.

Why have investors pushed \n\nU.S. equity prices so high even compared to strong \nfundamentals? There may be several drivers,18 but \n\nthe biggest one seems clear: investors expect strong \n\nU.S. earnings growth to continue or even accelerate, \n\nand they want a piece of it. \n\nEstimating Future Growth \n\nFor allocators assessing medium-term prospects for \n\nequity markets, what is a reasonable growth \n\nassumption?

Going forward, per-share and aggregate \nearnings may be more similar as buybacks offset issuance. \n\n20 There are other ways to estimate the market’s implied growth \nassumption. One could take a simple real yield measure for each country \n\nand calculate the growth rates required to make an equal set of real \n\nreturns. We choose to anchor to excess-of-cash returns because of the \ndifferent real cash rates available across countries. For each country we \n\nestimate the required excess return from a long-term Sharpe ratio \nassumption adjusted for breadth together with historical volatility. \n\n \n\n\x0cExhibit 12: Earnings Growth Assumptions \nby Country as of December 2024 \n\nFinal Thoughts \n\nAQR Alternative Thinking 2025 Issue 1: Capital Market Assumptions for Major Asset Classes 12 \n\nInvestors’ over-extrapolation of the relative growth \n\nprospects of individual companies is a key driver of \n\nthe long-term value premium, and it is likely the \n\nsame bias prevails in cross-country growth \n\ncomparisons and in cyclical time variation in \n\ngrowth expectations.  For allocators, there is a \n\nbalance to be struck: the structural advantages of the \n\nU.S. and the growth potential of new technologies \n\nshould be reflected in capital market assumptions; \n\nthe market’s tendencies toward over-extrapolation \n\nand over-exuberance (looming large at the start of \n\n2025) should not. \n\nThe long-term benefits of a diversified portfolio do \n\n \n\nnot accrue steadily, but rather come in waves. \n\nUnfortunately, many investors give up on \n\ndiversification – across regions and asset classes – \njust as the next wave is about to break.21  \n\n \n\nMarket-implied U.S. \n“growth premium”\n\nUS\n\nGlobal\nex US\n\nEuro-\nzone\n\nUK\n\nJapan\n\nAQR Growth Assumption\nMarket Implied Growth Assumption\n\nSource: Bloomberg, Reuters, Consensus Economics and AQR.

Prior to 1926, stocks are represented by a reconstruction of the S&P 500 available on Robert \n\nShiller’s website which uses dividends and earnings data from Cowles and associates, interpolated from \nannual data. After that, stocks are the S&P 500. Bonds are represented by long-dated Treasuries. The equity \n\nyield is a 50/50 mix of two measures: 50% Shiller E/P * 1.075 and 50% Dividend/Price + 1.5%.

We first produce historical time series of yield-based estimates \n\nfor U.S. equities and U.S. Treasuries using the method described in the previous paragraph (analysis starts in \n1900, but we use data from 1870s onwards). We test their predictive power using quarterly overlapping 10-year \n\nperiods since 1900 and measure the distribution of errors. See the 2018 edition for more details. Error ranges in \n\nExhibit 1 are based on interquartile ranges of these distributions, adjusted for current volatility estimates. \n\n12%\n\n10%\n\n8%\n\n6%\n\n4%\n\n2%\n\n0%\n\nn\nr\nu\n\nt\n\n \n\ne\nR\nD\nS\nU\n\n \nl\n\na\n\nt\n\no\nT\nd\ne\n\n \n\nt\nc\ne\np\nx\nE\n\n \n\n\x0cDisclosures \n\nAQR Alternative Thinking 2025 Issue 1 : Capital Market Assumptions for Major Asset Classes 14 \n\nThis document has been provided to you solely for information purposes and does not constitute an offer or solicitation of an offer or any advice or \nrecommendation to purchase any securities or other financial instruments and may not be construed as such.

Where applicable, performance fees are generally equal \nto 20% of net realized and unrealized profits each year, after restoration of any losses carried forward from prior years. In addition, AQR funds incur \nexpenses (including start-up, legal, accounting, audit, administrative and regulatory expenses) and may have redemption or withdrawal charges up to 2% \nbased on gross redemption or withdrawal proceeds.

NO \nREPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY FUND OR ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE \nSHOWN HEREIN. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE \nACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY REALIZED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM. ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL \nPERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL \nTRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF \nFINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING \nPROGRAM IN SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS THAT CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE \nNUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM, \nWHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS, ALL OF WHICH CAN \nADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. The hypothetical performance results contained herein represent the application of the \nquantitative models as currently in effect on the date first written above, and there can be no assurance that the models will remain the same in the future \nor that an application of the current models in the future will produce similar results because the relevant market and economic conditions that prevailed \nduring the hypothetical performance period will not necessarily recur. Discounting factors may be applied to reduce suspected anomalies. This backtest’s \nreturn, for this period, may vary depending on the date it is run. Hypothetical performance results are presented for illustrative purposes only. In addition, \nour transaction cost assumptions utilized in backtests, where noted, are based on AQR Capital Management LLC’s, (“AQR’s”) historical realized \ntransaction costs and market data. Certain of the assumptions have been made for modeling purposes and are unlikely to be realized. No representation \nor warranty is made as to the reasonableness of the assumptions made or that all assumptions used in achieving the returns have been stated or fully \nconsidered. Changes in the assumptions may have a material impact on the hypothetical returns presented. Actual advisory fees for products offering \nthis strategy may vary. \n\nThere is a risk of substantial loss associated with trading commodities, futures, options, derivatives, and other financial instruments. Before trading, \ninvestors should carefully consider their financial position and risk tolerance to determine whether the proposed trading style is appropriate. Investors \nshould realize that when trading futures, commodities, options, derivatives, and other financial instruments, one could lose the full balance of their \naccount. It is also possible to lose more than the initial deposit when trading derivatives or using leverage. All funds committed to such a trading strategy \nshould be purely risk capital. \n\nRegional Disclosures \n\nAustralia: AQR Capital Management, LLC, is exempt from the requirement to hold an Australian Financial Services License under the Corporations Act \n2001, pursuant to ASIC Class Order 03/1100 as continued by ASIC Legislative Instrument 2016/396 (as extended by amendment).

Payout-based: We estimate net total payout \n\ndiscount model (DDM), under which expected \n\nyield (NTY) as the sum of current dividend \n\nreal return is approximately the sum of \n\nyield and smoothed net buyback yield. To this \n\ndividend yield (DY), expected trend growth (g) \n\nwe add an estimate of long-term real growth of \n\nin real dividends or earnings per share (EPS), \n\nand expected change in valuation (∆v), that \nis: E(r) ≈ DY+g+∆v. We take the average of two \napproaches,3 described below. We assume no \n\nchange in valuations, i.e., no mean reversion \n\nfrom today’s (mostly high) valuations towards \nhistorical averages.4\n\naggregate payouts that includes net issuance. \nThis growth estimate, gTPagg, is an average \nof smoothed historical aggregate earnings \n\ngrowth and forecast GDP growth. So our \n\npayout-based expected return is: E(r) ≈ NTY + \ngTPagg, where NTY = DY + net buyback yield (NBY)\n\nMost estimates fell slightly during 2020 (after \n\n1.  Earnings-based: We start from the inverse \n\na rising in the first quarter), with Europe \n\nof the CAPE ratio (cyclically-adjusted P/E), \n\nand Australia seeing the biggest falls - see \n\nwhich is 10-year average inflation-adjusted \n\nExhibit\xa03. Our U.S. return estimate of 3.8% \n\nearnings divided by today’s price. We multiply \n\nover inflation remains low by historical \n\nby 0.5 (roughly the U.S. long-run dividend \n\nstandards.\n\npayout ratio), and add real earnings growth of \n\n1.5% (roughly the U.S. long-run average). So \nearnings-based expected return5 is: E(r) ≈ 0.5* \nAdjusted Shiller E/P + gEPS\n\n3  See the 2017 edition and its online appendix for details and discussion of the methodology.\n4  See the 2015 edition for a discussion of mean reversion in stock and bond valuations and our decision to exclude it. In short, our \n\nanalysis suggests mean reversion is unreliable and difficult to forecast, and there are plausible arguments for yields remaining lower \nthan historical levels.\n\n5  For our earnings-based estimate, we apply a 50% payout ratio to all countries, and use g = 1.5% for all countries except for emerging \nmarkets, where we use a higher growth rate of 2%.

This is \n\nwhere it is, and even modest positive returns \n\nillustrated in Exhibit 10, which also shows that \n\nmay be extremely valuable in a crisis. \n\ncommodities have tended to be an especially \n\nvaluable diversifier in such environments. \n\nThe negative SBC may be a mixed blessing \n\nTherefore, while low inflation and a negative \n\nfor bond investors, as it may reduce the \n\nSBC remain our central assumption for the \n\nrequired term premium: insurance doesn’t \n\nmedium term, an allocation to commodities \n\nusually come for free. The falling yields that \n\nand other real assets may help to increase \n\nhave contributed to positive bond returns in \n\na portfolio’s resilience to a range of \n\nrecent decades cannot fall forever.

Additional simulation analysis suggests that if yields are \n\nexpected to have room to fall 50-100 basis points from their present level, then near-term correlations and tail hedging properties are \nnot seriously affected by a potential lower bound (depending on other assumptions). This analysis will be explored in a later article.\n\n\x0c \n\nCapital Market Assumptions for Major Asset Classes  |  1Q21 \n\n13\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nYield-based expected returns for equities and \n\nestimates in this report do not in themselves \n\nbonds may be our best estimates of medium-\n\nwarrant aggressive tactical allocation \n\nterm prospects for these asset classes.

IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL \nPERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY REALIZED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM. \nONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF \nHINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN \nCOMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING.
