Elsewhere, we expect growth of 5% in the U.S. and 5%, and 6% in emerging markets.

With the U.S. moving into the later stages of the business cycle, and monetary and credit conditions diverging widely across the other major global economies, the potential for renewed volatility in both equity and fixed income markets remains high.']"

We think it's too early for the central banks to declare outright victory over inflation, and anticipate that rate cuts in 2024 are unlikely to pre-empt economic weakness. Investors should focus on locking in yields currently on offer in the bond market."", '2023 Investment Outlook APAC Version 1 Executive summary Introduction In September, the World Bank warned that “central banks around the world have been raising interest rates this year with a degree of synchronicity not seen over the past five decades” We believe we are currently in the contraction phase of the economic cycle with global growth below trend and decelerating. We think the contraction globally will be a modest soft patch, although some economies will be hit harder than others. If inflation remains stubbornly high, we assume central banks will continue tightening monetary policy for longer.', 'We enter 2020 with the conviction that at this stage a slowdown is in the nature of the cycle, but there are some specific features that characterise it as a peculiar regime. The retreat in global trade is causing a major change in the structure of growth, but does not point to a full-blown recession. Monetary and fiscal policy combination, a prominent theme going forward, may extend the current cycle further.']"
