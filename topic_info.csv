High inflation and the end of pandemic-related transfer payments reduced real disposable income in 2022. 2023 may actually see this situation reverse as the drivers of inflation give way and the pace of inflation drops.', 'In China, we see the robust recovery extending in 2021 with growth of 9%. Elsewhere, we expect growth of 5% in the U.S. and 5%, and 6% in emerging markets. Given a lower-for-longer rate outlook, we find it hard to see a material uptick in fixed income returns.', 'The majority of our 2023 10-Year Capital Market Assumptions forecast higher expected returns across most asset classes. Slowing global economic growth and the persistence of elevated inflation have weighed heavily on market returns in 2022. There have been few “safe-haven” assets in 2022, regardless of asset class, geography, market cap or style.']"

Assuming that the Middle East crisis remains contained, we expect a weaker global economic outlook, mainly driven by the slowdown in Developed Markets. The US will tiptoe into a recession in H1, as tight ﬁnancial conditions begin to bite on consumption and business sentiment. In Japan, growth should moderate but stay above potential.', '2023 Investment Outlook APAC Version 1 Executive summary Introduction In September, the World Bank warned that “central banks around the world have been raising interest rates this year with a degree of synchronicity not seen over the past five decades” We believe we are currently in the contraction phase of the economic cycle with global growth below trend and decelerating. We think the contraction globally will be a modest soft patch, although some economies will be hit harder than others. If inflation remains stubbornly high, we assume central banks will continue tightening monetary policy for longer.', 'Many of the world’s central banks, having largely succeeded in curbing inflation, are now easing monetary policies with the aim of stimulating growth. In 2025, we anticipate signs of economic deceleration to be counteracted by the supportive impact of the global rate-cutting cycle. Overall, we expect a conducive environment for risk assets, particularly in non- US developed markets, small capitalization stocks, and value sectors in the US.']"

For the 10-year period (2025–2034), higher valuations and lower risk premiums point to below-average expected returns for equities. However, we expect returns for both stocks and bonds will generally outpace inflation.', 'Long-term return expectations for capital markets serve as key inputs into our strategic asset allocation process for multi-asset portfolios.
